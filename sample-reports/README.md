## Regenerating Screenshots

If you modify the report template or want to update screenshots:

```bash
# From repository root
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r sample-reports/dev-requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
python sample-reports/scripts/capture_screenshots.py
```

See [Developer Guide](../docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#documentation-and-screenshots) for detailed instructions.

## For Developers

When updating the report template (`aiml-security-assessment/functions/security/generate_consolidated_report/report_template.py`):

1. Regenerate sample reports with your changes
2. Run the screenshot script to update documentation images
3. Commit both HTML reports and screenshots together

## Notes

- These are example reports with realistic but fictional findings
- Actual assessment results will vary based on your AWS environment
- Reports are fully self-contained HTML files (no external dependencies)
- Screenshots are automatically optimized to keep file sizes small
