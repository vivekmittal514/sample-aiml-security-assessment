# COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS: registry of compliance-standard sections.
# Each entry produces a sidebar nav item + service card + section + filter
# option + scope chip in the report. Callers (generate_consolidated_report
# and consolidate_html_reports) also iterate this list to initialise
# service_stats/service_findings and route Check_ID prefixes.
#
# Required keys: slug, name, prefix, icon, icon_small, reference_url,
# section_title, scope_text.
#
# Optional key "derived" (bool, default False). A derived standard runs no
# assessment Lambda and writes no CSV to S3; its rows are computed at
# consolidation time from verdicts that checks already shipping produced (see
# aisf_mappings.derive_aisf_findings). A producing standard has an assessment
# function whose CSV lands under "<slug>_security_report_" in the assessment
# bucket.
#
# Appending an entry here is NOT sufficient on its own, contrary to what this
# comment claimed before AISF was added. Two things sit outside the loops:
#
#  1. S3 prefix construction. generate_consolidated_report/app.py turns every
#     non-derived slug into a list_objects_v2 prefix, and that function's
#     s3:ListBucket grant in template.yaml restricts s3:prefix to a fixed
#     StringLike list. A slug that writes no artifact draws AccessDenied,
#     which the caller re-raises, so the whole report fails. That is what the
#     "derived" key prevents: it keeps such a slug out of the prefix list.
#     Registering a producing standard instead means extending the IAM
#     condition and the artifact-validation sites too.
#  2. Row production. Nothing in the report layer invents rows. A producing
#     standard needs its Step Functions branch and its CSV; a derived standard
#     needs an explicit derivation call in both consolidators. A registered
#     standard with zero rows renders nothing at all (see "if _total <= 0:
#     continue" in the compliance loop below), which is indistinguishable from
#     a wiring bug, so registration and the first rows ship together.
