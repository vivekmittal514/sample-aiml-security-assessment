"""AISF framework view: derive `AISF-*` rows from check verdicts that already ship.

The AWS AI Security Framework (AISF) is registered in
`report_template.COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS` as a **derived** standard. No Lambda runs
AISF checks, no AISF CSV is written to S3, and no Step Functions branch exists
for it. Every row in this module is a relabelling of a verdict an incumbent
check already produced, computed at consolidation time by
`derive_aisf_findings()`.

Why derived rather than a producing module: an incumbent check already asserts
each of the three AISF controls handled here exactly, so there is nothing new to
call. A control an incumbent asserts only in part must NOT be added here:
restating its `Passed` under the AISF control id would publish a false pass.

**Ids are allocated once and never renumbered.** `AISF_DERIVED_MAP` is
append-only: a new control takes the next free `AISF-` number. Reusing or
resequencing an id silently rewrites the meaning of every archived report and
CSV that already carries it. `AISF-00` is reserved for the coverage marker row
emitted by `derive_aisf_findings()` and must never be allocated to a control.
An id removed from the map moves to `RETIRED_AISF_IDS` and is never
reallocated either, so the next control takes the number after the highest id
in the two together.

The control text (risk, severity, resolution, reference) is baked into the literal
because the AISF repository is not on the Lambda's filesystem at runtime. A
change to a control's YAML in that repository has to be copied here by hand.

# `critical` is the only such band today: `high`, `medium` and `low` keep their
# names. A future band that does not is caught by
# `tests/test_aisf_derived_standard.py`. Adding

On a bring-your-own vector store the Bedrock CMK covers only transient ingestion storage and the retrieval session (kmsKeyArn on RetrieveAndGenerate); it reaches the index itself only where Bedrock created that store for you (quick create for OpenSearch Serverless or Amazon S3 Vectors). Otherwise encrypt each store on its own terms: an OpenSearch Serverless collection is always encrypted at rest but uses a CMK only when an encryption policy sets AWSOwnedKey false with KmsARN (or CreateCollection names the key), and the choice is immutable — changing it means recreating the collection. Aurora pgvector inherits the DB cluster's own StorageEncrypted KMS key. Pinecone, Redis Enterprise Cloud and MongoDB Atlas are third-party SaaS that AWS KMS does not encrypt, so the AWS-side controls there are a CMK on the Secrets Manager secret holding the credentials plus TLS in transit. Set serverSideEncryptionConfiguration.kmsKeyArn on each data source. Critically, the key is not the access boundary: OpenSearch Serverless does not check a caller's permissions on the CMK, so anyone a data access policy admits can query the encrypted vectors — restrict the index with the collection's data access policy and network policy plus aoss:APIAccessAll scoped to that one collection ARN.",

Get the S3 path right, because the obvious reading of network isolation is wrong here and it changes what your endpoint and bucket policies must admit: the algorithm container never reads or writes S3 itself. AWS documents that internal SageMaker processes running on the nodes download the input data and upload the results, and that whether or not you specify VpcConfig the container is given no AWS credentials. With VpcConfig, SageMaker creates two elastic network interfaces — one for the algorithm container and one for Amazon S3 — and EnableNetworkIsolation removes the container's interface while the S3 interface remains and is what carries the transfer. So an Amazon S3 gateway VPC endpoint is still required for a private path, but scope its endpoint policy and the bucket policy to the SageMaker-managed transfer and the job's execution role rather than to any identity inside the container. Encrypt at rest with KMS customer-managed keys on the job — TransformResources.VolumeKmsKeyId for the compute EBS volume and TransformOutput.KmsKeyId for the S3 results — and keep the source/output buckets SSE-KMS with an aws:SecureTransport deny. Note where preventive IAM can and cannot carry this: CreateTransformJob defines sagemaker:OutputKmsKeyArn and sagemaker:VolumeKmsKeyArn condition keys, so the KMS half is enforceable with an SCP on the job itself, while sagemaker:NetworkIsolation, sagemaker:VpcSubnets and sagemaker:VpcSecurityGroupIds are CreateModel keys only — the guardrail has to be written across both actions, and a policy that conditions only on CreateTransformJob leaves the network posture unenforced.
