"""OWASP Top 10 for LLM assessment Lambda.

This Lambda runs after the per-service Lambdas (Bedrock, SageMaker, AgentCore,
Responsible AI GRC) have written their region CSVs. It:

1. Reads those CSVs from S3.
2. Applies OWASP_CHECK_MAPPINGS to emit OW-01..OW-10 rows derived from
   existing BR/SM/AC/FS findings.
3. Runs two net-new checks for LLM07 (System Prompt Leakage):
   - OW-11: flag Lambda functions whose env vars look like embedded system prompts
   - OW-12: verify a Bedrock guardrail denies system-prompt-disclosure topics
4. Writes owasp_security_report_<execution_id>_<region>.csv to the assessment bucket.

Gated at the Step Functions layer via the `OWASP Enabled?` Choice state.
