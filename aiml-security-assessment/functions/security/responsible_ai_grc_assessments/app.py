AWS FinServ GenAI Risk Assessment Lambda
=========================================
Implements 65 security checks (64 standalone + 1 shared FS-27 entry for the new
Automated Reasoning Policies check) derived from the AWS guide:
"Financial Services risk management of the use of Generative AI"
https://d1.awsstatic.com/onedam/marketing-channels/website/public/global-FinServ-ComplianceGuide-GenAIRisks-public.pdf

Check ID namespace: FS-01 through FS-69
  FS-01 to FS-63 — original 63 checks across 15 risk categories
                   (FS-17, FS-18, FS-19 merged into upstream SM-07, SM-23, SM-22)
  FS-64 to FS-69 — 6 material gap checks covering mitigations explicitly
                   called out in the Guide but absent from FS-01..63 and
                   the existing BR/SM/AC checks in the AIML Security Assessment.
                   (FS-64 merged into upstream BR-04)

5 checks (FS-17, FS-18, FS-19, FS-23, FS-64) are contributed as upstream extensions
rather than standalone entries — see extension notes in the
SECURITY_CHECKS_RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC Part 1 and Part 3 markdown files.

FS-27 is split into two check functions sharing the same check_id:
  1. check_guardrail_contextual_grounding() — verifies contextualGroundingPolicy
     on guardrails (threshold-based, per-inference filtering).
  2. check_automated_reasoning_policies() — verifies Bedrock Automated Reasoning
     policies (formal verification, GA August 2025, limited regions).
Both use FS-27 in the CSV and both appear in the build_finserv_checks() registry.

These checks complement the existing BR/SM/AC checks in the AIML Security Assessment.

COMPLIANCE_PLACEHOLDER: Each check maps to FinServ regulatory frameworks via the
COMPLIANCE_MAP dict below. These mappings now travel with every finding row in the
CSV report (the Compliance_Frameworks column) — see COMPLIANCE_MAP and create_finding.
Frameworks referenced: FFIEC CAT, SR 11-7, NYDFS 500.06, PCI-DSS 12.3.2, SOC 2 CC6,
ISO 27001 A.12, DORA Art.6, MAS TRM 9.

Contribution workflow:
  - Upstream repo: aws-samples/sample-aiml-security-assessment (OSPO-managed, so forks
    are auto-approved by Amazon Code Defender).
  - This Lambda is delivered via a personal fork + feature branch + PR. See
    GIT_WORKFLOW.md for the full 9-step process (fork, branch, ASH scan, commit, push,
    PR, GitHub Actions verification, reviewer assignment, optional Git Defender
    exception ticket).

Pre-commit quality gates (run every edit):
  1. ruff check + ruff format --check on this directory.
  2. sam local invoke ResponsibleAIGRCAssessmentFunction against a test event.
  3. cfn-lint / sam validate on the updated SAM templates.
  4. ash --source-dir <repo> --fail-on-findings --config-overrides
     'global_settings.severity_threshold=MEDIUM' — resolve every Critical and High
     finding before opening the PR.
  5. git defender scan on the staged diff.

    calling the operation directly and following its continuation token.

    Calling the bound method directly (rather than via get_paginator) keeps this
    uniform across services and unit-test mocks. The AWS APIs this Lambda uses
    employ three continuation-token conventions, all handled here:
      - NextToken / NextToken            (organizations, sagemaker, config, events, ...)
      - nextToken / nextToken            (bedrock, bedrock-agent, ecr, ...)

      - position / position              (apigateway)

    A single-page response (no continuation token) yields exactly one call, so
    this is a safe drop-in for previously non-paginated reads and for mocks that
    stub the operation with a single return value.

    Args:
        token: Optional explicit ``(output_field, input_param)`` pair that
            bypasses the convention table entirely.  When set, ``token[0]`` is
            read from each response to find the continuation value and
            ``token[1]`` is the request kwarg used to send it on the next call.
            Use this for operations whose token convention is not in the table,
            or where the output and input names differ from every entry already
            there (e.g. WAFv2 ``NextMarker``/``NextMarker`` vs Lambda's
            ``NextMarker``/``Marker``).  When ``None`` (the default) the
            existing convention table is used unchanged — all current callers
            pass no ``token`` argument and are therefore byte-for-byte identical

# SEVERITY METHODOLOGY (see
# docs/SECURITY_CHECKS_RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC_SEVERITY_METHODOLOGY.md
# + docs/SECURITY_CHECKS_RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC_SEVERITY_REGISTER.md)
#
# Severity = property of the CONTROL (the risk it mitigates), assigned once via a
# Likelihood (L) x Impact (I) matrix mapped to the AWS Security Hub ASFF label set,
# then applied to every Passed/Failed row of that control. The N/A family follows a
# fixed disposition rule so "nothing to assess" rows are consistent.
#
#   Matrix (I x L -> label), 1=Low 2=Medium 3=High:
#       I=3: L1->Medium  L2->High    L3->High
#       I=2: L1->Low     L2->Medium  L3->High
#       I=1: L1->Low     L2->Low     L3->Medium
#   (Critical is intentionally NOT used in this round — see methodology §6.)
#
#   Disposition -> severity:
#       PASS / FAIL          -> control severity (from the matrix)
#       NOT_APPLICABLE       -> Informational  (ASFF: "no issue was found")
#       ADVISORY             -> Informational  (no API can verify it)
#       COULD_NOT_ASSESS     -> Low            (unknown state; re-run after fixing access)
#       SOFT_WARNING         -> control severity (intentional non-failing assessed state)

    """
    FS-16 — Report whether ECR repositories that may hold model containers are
    covered by vulnerability scanning, from either mechanism.

    Evidence collected: DescribeRepositories for
    ``imageScanningConfiguration.scanOnPush`` per repository, plus
    inspector2 BatchGetAccountStatus for ``resourceState.ecr.status``.

    Both mechanisms must be considered together. Amazon Inspector enhanced
    scanning is account-wide and continuously scans ECR repositories,
    superseding per-repository scan-on-push. An earlier revision read only
    scanOnPush and therefore raised a High finding for every repository in an
    Inspector-enabled account — verified live against an account with
    resourceState.ecr=ENABLED and five repositories at scanOnPush=false.

    A subsequent revision fixed that but introduced a related defect: a
    ClientError from BatchGetAccountStatus was caught and the Inspector state
    set to an "UNKNOWN (...)" string, which then compared unequal to
    "ENABLED" the same way "DISABLED" would. So a permissions gap on the
    Inspector call was indistinguishable from Inspector genuinely being off,
    and any repository without scan-on-push produced a Failed finding even
    though whether Inspector covered it was never actually determined. The
    Inspector lookup failure is now tracked separately and reported as
    COULD NOT ASSESS whenever it is the reason a repository cannot be
    classified, rather than defaulting to "not enabled".

    That still missed a case: BatchGetAccountStatus can fail *without*
    raising. Verified live — an account ID Inspector cannot resolve comes
    back as a normal 200 response, ``{"accounts": [], "failedAccounts":
    [{"accountId": ..., "errorCode": "ACCESS_DENIED", ...}]}``, so the
    ClientError handler never runs and the account is simply absent from the
    array the code iterated. The status is now matched to the queried
    account ID explicitly (not assumed to be the first entry); a matching
    failedAccounts entry, or the account appearing in neither array, both set
    the same unknown-reason path as a raised ClientError.

    Deliberately NOT asserted:
      - that any image has actually been scanned,
      - that scan findings have been triaged or remediated,
      - that a repository holds model containers at all (scope is every
        repository in the region, not only AI/ML ones).

    """
    FS-25 — Report the effective encryption key of each OpenSearch Serverless
    collection used as a Bedrock Knowledge Base vector store.

    Evidence collected: ListCollections, reading ``kmsKeyArn`` per collection.

    Signal note: ``kmsKeyArn`` is the effective key for the collection. It is
    the literal string ``"auto"`` when the collection uses an AWS-owned key,
    and a KMS key ARN when it uses a customer-managed key (CMK) — verified
    live against two purpose-built collections.

    Why not the encryption policy documents: ListSecurityPolicies summaries do
    NOT include the policy document (only type, name, policyVersion,
    description and dates), so an earlier revision's
    ``json.loads(policy.get("policy", "{}"))`` always produced ``{}``. The
    subsequent ``"AWSOwnedKey" not in "{}"`` test was therefore always true,
    every policy was classified as CMK, and the Failed branch was unreachable.
    Verified live: an account with six AWS-owned-key policies reported
    "7 use a customer-managed KMS key". Reading the documents would require
    GetSecurityPolicy per policy and then matching policy resource patterns to
    collections; ``kmsKeyArn`` gives the effective answer directly.

    Scope note: the verdict keys off collections, not policies. An encryption
    policy with no matching collection protects nothing, so orphaned policies
    are not reported as a failure.

    Deliberately NOT asserted:
      - that the CMK's key policy, rotation or grants are appropriate,
      - that a collection is actually used by a Knowledge Base,
      - anything about non-OpenSearch vector stores (S3 Vectors, Aurora,
        Pinecone), whose encryption must be verified separately.

    completed an ingestion job.

    Evidence collected: the shared KB inventory for data sources, then
    ListIngestionJobs per data source, taking the most recent job whose status
    is COMPLETE and reading its updatedAt (falling back to startedAt).

    Timestamp note: a data source's own ``updatedAt`` is when its CONFIGURATION
    last changed, not when it last synced. An earlier revision used that field
    and labelled it "last synced". Verified live: a source whose configuration
    was last modified 2025-11-21 had in fact completed an ingestion on
    2025-11-26, so the config timestamp overstated staleness by five days. In
    the opposite direction, a source edited yesterday that had never synced
    would have been reported as current.

    Deliberately NOT asserted:
      - that a completed ingestion indexed the content you expected,
      - that the source data itself is current,
      - that the configured cadence matches your currency requirement.

    Staleness threshold: AWS does not prescribe a maximum data age for Knowledge
    Bases — the appropriate cadence is workload-specific (intraday for market
    data, weekly/monthly for slow-changing regulatory guidance). This check uses
    a default of 7 days purely as a review prompt; treat a finding as "confirm

    """
    FS-43 — Report whether the CloudWatch log group that receives Bedrock model
    invocation logs has a data protection policy masking PII.

    Evidence collected: GetModelInvocationLoggingConfiguration to learn whether
    invocation logging is enabled and where it delivers, then
    DescribeAccountPolicies(DATA_PROTECTION_POLICY) for account-scoped policies
    and GetDataProtectionPolicy for the specific log group.

    Applicability matters, and an earlier revision ignored it. That revision
    tested only whether any account-scoped policy existed, which produced two
    wrong answers, both verified live:
      - Bedrock delivering invocation logs to S3 only (no cloudWatchConfig)
        still reported a High failure about plaintext PII in CloudWatch, where
        no Bedrock logs exist at all.
      - A log group carrying its own data protection policy still reported
        "No CloudWatch Logs Data Protection Policies", because a log-group
        policy is invisible to DescribeAccountPolicies.

    A subsequent revision fixed both of those but introduced a third: a
    ClientError from DescribeAccountPolicies or GetDataProtectionPolicy was
    caught and treated as "no policy found" for that call, so an access-denied
    permissions gap on either API silently became a Failed finding indistin-
    guishable from a genuinely unprotected log group. Both calls are now
    tracked tri-state (found / confirmed absent / unknown), and a Failed
    verdict requires that both were confirmed absent — an unknown side, with
    no policy found on the other, is reported as COULD NOT ASSESS instead.

    Deliberately NOT asserted:

    context for that review.

    Evidence collected: ListFoundationModels for ``modelLifecycle.status`` and
    DescribeConfigRules for rules whose name mentions "lifecycle" or "model".

    Scope note, and the reason this check was restructured:
    ListFoundationModels returns the REGION CATALOGUE, not the models this
    account uses. Verified live: us-east-1 offers 119 models of which 19 are
    LEGACY, none necessarily used by the account. An earlier revision failed the
    check whenever a legacy model existed in the region and no Config rule was
    found, which fires on virtually every account in the region regardless of
    posture, and its passing branch ("No legacy models detected") was
    effectively unreachable. The account-specific signal is the absence of
    lifecycle governance, so that is what the verdict now keys off; legacy
    availability is reported as context.

    Deliberately NOT asserted:
      - that the account invokes any of the legacy models listed,
      - that a matching Config rule actually enforces model currency,
      - that a documented lifecycle process exists outside AWS Config.
    Name-matched Config rules are a heuristic for "some governance exists",
    not proof of an effective process.

    Detect whether a target region has GenAI resources that justify regional

        False when EVERY probe either succeeds with an empty result or is not

        None when at least one probe's result is indeterminate (permissions or

    A region is only ever reported as empty (False) when the full picture is

    empty, even when another probe in the same loop was indeterminate — so an
    AccessDenied on, say, SageMaker while Bedrock Guardrails happened to be
    empty produced a confident "no resources" verdict from a partially unknown
    picture. Downstream, that would emit an FS-00 "no regional resources

    confirmed-empty probe result whenever at least one probe could not be
