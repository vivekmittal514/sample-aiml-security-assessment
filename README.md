# ReSCO AI/ML Security Assessments

## Overview

This project contains a collection of tools and frameworks for performing security assessments for your AI/ML workload on your single AWS account or multiple AWS accounts. It uses AWS serverless services to gather the data from the control plane and provide a list of assessments with the severity level and recommended actions.

ReSCO assessments help organizations evaluate and improve their:

- **Resilience**: System reliability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery capabilities
- **Security**: Security posture, compliance, and risk management
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource utilization, cost efficiency, and optimization opportunities

This repo focus on performing security assessment for your workloads using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.github.io/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit/), or [Amazon Sagemaker AI](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/).

## Architecture

![Architecture](./generated-diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

## Single-Account Deployment

1. Download [aiml-security-assessment-single-account.yaml](deployment/aiml-security-assessment-single-account.yaml) CloudFormation template.
2. 🚀 **[Deploy to AWS CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=resco-aiml-single-account)**
3. Upload CloudFormation template from step 1.
4. Provide a stack name and optionally specify your email address to receive notifications.
5. Leave all other parameters as default.
6. Navigate to the next page, read and acknowledge the notice, and click **Next**.
7. Review the information and click on **Submit**.
8. Wait for CloudFormation stack to complete.
9. Once complete, CodeBuild will automatically deploy the assessment stack and run the assessment.
10. To view results:
    - Navigate to CloudFormation console
    - Open the `aiml-sec-{account_id}` stack (created by SAM, e.g., `aiml-sec-123456789012`)
    - Go to the **Outputs** tab
    - Copy the `AssessmentBucketName` value
    - Navigate to that S3 bucket and open the `security_assessment_*.html` file

## Multi-Account Deployment

### Prerequisite

- AWS Organizations setup with management account access or delegated administrator member account.

### The deployment follows a two-step approach:

### Step 1: Deploy Member Roles (StackSets)

Deploy [1-resco-member-roles.yaml](deployment/1-resco-member-roles.yaml) to all target accounts using CloudFormation StackSets.

#### AWS Console Deployment

1. Navigate to **CloudFormation** > **StackSets**
2. Create StackSet with [1-resco-member-roles.yaml](deployment/1-resco-member-roles.yaml)
3. Set `ReSCOAccountID` parameter to your management account ID
4. Deploy to target organizational units or accounts

### Step 2: Deploy Central Infrastructure

Deploy [2-resco-assessment-codebuild.yaml](deployment/2-resco-assessment-codebuild.yaml) in your central management account or delegated administrator member account..

#### AWS Console Deployment

1. Navigate to [AWS CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=resco-aiml-multi-account)
2. Select **Upload a template file** and upload [2-resco-assessment-codebuild.yaml](deployment/2-resco-assessment-codebuild.yaml) file.
3. Select `MultiAccountScan` parameter as true
4. Provide your email address in `EmailAddress` parameter.
5. Leave rest of the parameters as default.
6. Click **Next** and configure the parameters
7. Stack creation automatically triggers CodeBuild

## How It Works

### Single Account Mode (`MultiAccountScan=false`)

- Creates local `ReSCOAIMLMemberRole`
- Runs assessment in the same account
- Uses local S3 bucket for results

### Multi-Account Mode (`MultiAccountScan=true`)

- Lists all active accounts in AWS Organizations
- Assumes `ReSCOAIMLMemberRole` in each target account
- Deploys selected assessment modules in each account with shared S3 bucket
- Executes Step Functions for each deployed module in each account
- Consolidates results by assessment type in central S3 bucket

### Assessment Execution Process

#### Automatic Trigger

- CodeBuild project starts automatically after central stack creation
- Lambda trigger function initiates the assessment workflow

#### Multi-Account Orchestration

1. **Account Discovery**: CodeBuild queries AWS Organizations for active accounts
2. **Role Assumption**: Assumes `ReSCOAIMLMemberRole` in each target account
3. **Module Deployment**: Deploys the AI/ML assessment module:
   - Bedrock Assessment Lambda
   - SageMaker Assessment Lambda
   - AgentCore Assessment Lambda
   - IAM Permission Caching Lambda
   - Consolidated Report Generation Lambda
4. **Assessment Execution**: Step Functions orchestrate parallel Lambda execution
5. **Results Collection**: Individual Lambda functions store results in local S3 buckets
6. **Consolidation**: CodeBuild collects and consolidates results from all accounts
7. **Reporting**: Generates multi-account HTML and CSV reports
8. **Notification**: Sends completion notification via SNS (if configured)

## Permissions Required

### Central Account Role (`ReSCOCodeBuildRole`)

- Assume roles in member accounts
- List AWS Organizations accounts
- Deploy CloudFormation/SAM applications
- Execute Step Functions
- Write to S3 bucket

### Member Account Role (`ReSCOAIMLMemberRole`)

- Read-only access to AIML services (Bedrock, SageMaker, AgentCore)
- IAM read permissions for security assessment
- CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Lambda read permissions
- VPC and EC2 read permissions
- ECR, CloudWatch Logs, X-Ray read permissions (for AgentCore)

## Monitoring and Results

- **S3 Bucket**: Central storage for all assessment results
- **CloudWatch Logs**: CodeBuild execution logs
- **SNS Notifications**: Email alerts on completion/failure
- **EventBridge Rules**: Automated workflow triggers

## Viewing Assessment Results

You can check CodeBuild service to ensure that the assessment run has completed successfully before accessing the assessment results.

### Accessing Results

1. **Find the S3 Bucket Name**:
   - Navigate to **CloudFormation** > **Stacks** in the AWS Console
   - For single account, select the `aiml-sec-{account_id}` stack (e.g., `aiml-sec-123456789012`)
   - For multi account, select the `resco-aiml-multi-account` stack created in [Step 2: Deploy Central Infrastructure](#step-2-deploy-central-infrastructure)
   - Go to the **Outputs** tab
   - Copy the S3 bucket name from the `AssessmentBucketName` output

2. **Navigate to S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to **S3** in the AWS Console
   - Search for and open your assessment bucket
   - For single account, open security_assessment_XXXXX.html report
   - For multi-account, follow below [Report Structure](#report-structure) guidance

## Customization

### Adding New Accounts

#### Option A: AWS Console

1. Navigate to **CloudFormation** > **StackSets**
2. Select `resco-aiml-member-roles` StackSet
3. Click **Add stacks to StackSet**
4. Choose deployment targets:
   - **Deploy to accounts**: Enter specific account IDs
   - **Regions**: Select target regions
5. Review and click **Submit**

### Modifying Assessment Scope

Edit the member role permissions in `1-resco-member-roles.yaml` to add/remove service permissions.

### Concurrent Scanning

Adjust `ConcurrentAccountScans` parameter based on your organization size and cost considerations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **StackSet Deployment Failures**: Check service-linked roles and permissions
2. **Cross-Account Role Assumption**: Verify trust relationships and account IDs
3. **SAM Deployment Failures**: Check CodeBuild logs for specific errors
4. **Step Functions Execution**: Monitor state machine executions in each account

### Debugging

- Check CodeBuild project logs in CloudWatch
- Verify cross-account role trust policies
- Ensure S3 bucket permissions allow cross-account writes
- Monitor Step Functions executions for individual account assessments
