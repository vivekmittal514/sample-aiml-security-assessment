**Open-source automated security scanner for generative AI and machine learning workloads on AWS.** It brings together assessments for Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. Core checks are guided by the [AWS Well-Architected Generative AI Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/generative-ai-lens/generative-ai-lens.html). The optional **Responsible AI GRC** module adds technical checks for AI governance, risk, and compliance. Optional **OWASP Top 10 for LLM** checks extend coverage across common LLM security risks. Responsible AI GRC checks draw on the [AWS User Guide to Governance, Risk, and Compliance for Responsible AI Adoption](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS-User-Guide-Governance-Risk-Compliance-for-Responsible-AI-Adoption-Financial-Services.pdf).

Run **[194 checks](docs/SECURITY_CHECKS.md)** across AWS accounts and regions:

- **86 always-on core checks** for Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
- **32 always-on Agentic AI Security checks**, synthesized from service findings and native AgentCore gateway checks
- **64 optional Responsible AI GRC checks** for selected technical controls informed by AWS governance, risk, and compliance guidance
- **12 optional OWASP Top 10 for LLM checks**, including mapping-based coverage and native system-prompt-leakage checks

Deploy in a single account or across AWS Organizations. Assessments support multi-region execution and produce interactive, shareable reports with severity ratings, filtering, search, remediation references, and per-account/per-region views. Assessment artifacts are stored in your AWS account; the deployment build pulls source from the configured repository.

> **Scope note:** Responsible AI GRC provides selected AWS configuration checks for AI governance, risk, and compliance. It complements architectural reviews such as the AWS Well-Architected Responsible AI Lens and broader compliance programs. See [Responsible AI GRC scope, sources, and compatibility](docs/RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC_SCOPE.md).

## What It Does

This serverless assessment framework automatically evaluates your AI/ML workloads against AWS security best practices. It uses AWS serverless services to gather data from the control plane and generate reports containing the status of various security checks, severity levels, and recommended actions.

Designed for workloads using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.github.io/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit/), [Amazon SageMaker AI](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/), or the optional Responsible AI GRC assessment.

### Why Use This Framework?

| Challenge | How This Framework Helps |
| --- | --- |
| **Manual security audits are time-consuming** | Fully automated scanning with one-click CloudFormation deployment |
| **Inconsistent security checks across teams** | Standardized 194-check assessment based on AWS Well-Architected Generative AI Lens and Agentic AI Lens best practices, AWS Responsible AI governance/risk/compliance guidance for financial services, and OWASP Top 10 for LLM |
| **Difficulty tracking AI/ML security posture** | Interactive HTML dashboards with severity breakdown and per-account visibility |
| **Multi-account complexity** | Consolidated reporting across AWS Organizations with cross-account role assumption |
| **Compliance and audit support** | Exportable reports to supplement your compliance program, with remediation guidance linked to AWS documentation |
| **Generative AI security gaps** | Purpose-built checks for LLM guardrails, model access controls, and prompt injection prevention |

**Services Covered:**

- **[Amazon Bedrock](docs/SECURITY_CHECKS.md#amazon-bedrock-security-checks-40)** (40 always-on core checks) - Covers guardrails, prompt-attack and image filtering, cross-account policies, data retention, inference profiles, automated reasoning and Marketplace endpoint encryption/networking, Amazon VPC endpoints, IAM permissions, agent guardrails and least privilege, logging, monitoring, evaluation, quotas, and Lambda code scanning.
- **[Amazon SageMaker AI](docs/SECURITY_CHECKS.md#amazon-sagemaker-ai-security-checks-29)** (29 always-on core checks) - Covers AWS Security Hub controls, internet and VPC exposure, encryption, isolation, GuardDuty AI Protection, HyperPod, Model Registry resource policies, MLOps, monitoring, approval, drift detection, deployment patterns, and lineage tracking. `SM-29` remains reserved for a deferred Unified Studio networking check; `SM-30` is implemented.
- **[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](docs/SECURITY_CHECKS.md#amazon-bedrock-agentcore-security-checks-17)** (17 always-on core checks) - Covers runtime, Code Interpreter, and browser VPC isolation; Identity token-vault encryption; browser recording; memory, policy-engine, and gateway encryption; observability; VPC endpoints; policies; and online evaluation.
- **[Agentic AI Security](docs/SECURITY_CHECKS.md#agentic-ai-security-checks-32)** (32 always-on checks) - Covers bounded autonomy, agent identity and access, tool authorization, guardrail enforcement, prompt/input protection, memory privacy, auditability and continuous assurance, and abuse/cost protection. Maps selected Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore findings into the [AWS Well-Architected Agentic AI Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/agentic-ai-lens/agentic-ai-lens.html) view and adds native AgentCore gateway checks.
- **[Responsible AI GRC](docs/SECURITY_CHECKS.md#responsible-ai-grc-checks-64-additional-5-upstream-extensions)** (64 opt-in checks) - Covers unbounded consumption, excessive agency, supply chain, training data poisoning, vector weaknesses, non-compliant output, misinformation, harmful or biased output, PII disclosure, hallucination, prompt injection, improper output handling, off-topic output, and out-of-date training data. Enable with `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment`; checks are derived from the [AWS User Guide to Governance, Risk, and Compliance for Responsible AI Adoption](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS-User-Guide-Governance-Risk-Compliance-for-Responsible-AI-Adoption-Financial-Services.pdf).
- **[OWASP Top 10 for LLM](docs/SECURITY_CHECKS.md#owasp-top-10-for-llm-checks-12)** (12 opt-in checks) - Covers LLM01 through LLM10 by mapping existing Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, and Responsible AI GRC findings, plus two native LLM07 checks for system prompt leakage. Enable with `EnableOWASPAssessment`; results align to the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/) and render in the "By Compliance Standard" report section. When needed, this also runs Responsible AI GRC as a hidden source dependency.

**Deployment Options:**

- **Single-Account**: Assess security in one AWS account
- **Multi-Account**: Scan entire AWS Organizations with consolidated reporting

**How It Works:**

1. Deploy through AWS CloudFormation (one-click deployment)
2. Framework automatically scans your AI/ML resources
3. Generates interactive HTML reports stored in your Amazon S3 bucket
4. All data stays in your AWS account - no external dependencies

---

## Scope and Limitations

This tool operates within the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/). It assesses **your configuration responsibilities** (IAM policies, encryption settings, network isolation, logging) for AI/ML services. It does not assess AWS-managed infrastructure, physical security, or the underlying service platform.

**Point-in-time assessment.** Each run captures your security posture at the moment of execution. Resource configurations can change immediately after an assessment completes. Run assessments regularly and after significant changes to maintain visibility.

**No guarantee of security or compliance.** This framework identifies common misconfigurations based on AWS best practices and the AWS Well-Architected Framework. It does not cover all possible security risks, does not replace formal compliance audits (SOC 2, HIPAA, and similar), and does not guarantee that your workloads are secure. Use the results as one input into your broader security program.

**194 checks across six areas.** The assessment covers Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, always-on Agentic AI Security, optional Responsible AI GRC checks, and optional OWASP Top 10 for LLM checks. Other AI/ML services (Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Textract, and others) are not currently assessed.

## Architecture

![Architecture](./docs/diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 — [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- AWS SAM CLI — [Install the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- Docker (optional) — [Install Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community) — Only required for local development

---

## Single-Account Deployment

1. Download the [aiml-security-single-account.yaml](deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml) CloudFormation template.
2. **[Deploy to AWS CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template?stackName=aiml-security-single-account)**
3. Upload the template and provide a stack name.
4. Optionally specify your email address to receive notifications.
5. **(Optional) Multi-Region**: Set `TargetRegions` to scan multiple regions:

   - Leave empty to scan only the deployment region (default)
   - Comma- or space-separated list (for example, `us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1` or `us-east-1 us-west-2 eu-west-1`)
   - `all` to scan all regions where the services are available

6. Review the optional [security policy baselines](#optional-security-policy-baselines), especially the Marketplace endpoint CMK requirement, which defaults to enabled.
7. Acknowledge IAM capabilities and click **Submit**.
8. Once complete, CodeBuild automatically runs the assessment.
9. View results: go to the stack **Outputs** tab → copy `AssessmentBucket` → open the report under the `/{account_id}/` prefix in that S3 bucket.

> **Tip**: The deployment creates two stacks. Your results are in the stack *you named*, not the auto-generated `aiml-sec-*` stack. See [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#11-confused-by-multiple-cloudformation-stacks) for details.

---

## Multi-Account Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy Member Roles

Deploy [1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml](deployment/1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml) to all target accounts using CloudFormation StackSets with service-managed permissions.

1. Navigate to **CloudFormation** > **StackSets** in the AWS Organizations management account or delegated administrator account
2. Upload the template and set `ManagementAccountID` to the account ID where the central multi-account CodeBuild project runs
3. Select **Service-managed permissions** and target your OUs
4. Select your target region and submit

### Step 2: Deploy Central Infrastructure

Deploy [2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml](deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml) in your central assessment account. This can be your AWS Organizations management account or a delegated administrator/central tooling account.

1. Upload the template and set `MultiAccountScan` to `true`
2. Optionally set `TargetRegions` for multi-region scanning
3. Optionally provide an email address for notifications
4. Configure the optional [security policy baselines](#optional-security-policy-baselines); the central values are propagated to every per-account SAM deployment
5. Acknowledge IAM capabilities and submit
6. Stack creation automatically triggers the assessment across all accounts

---

## Optional Security Policy Baselines

The deployment templates expose organization-specific baselines for checks that
cannot infer your intended trust or hardening policy. Defaults preserve advisory
behavior except for Marketplace endpoint customer-managed encryption, which is
enforced by default.

| CloudFormation parameter | Default | Affected check | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RequireBedrockZeroDataRetention` | `false` | BR-37 | When `true`, the Bedrock account retention modes `default` and `inherit` fail the explicit zero-data-retention baseline. `provider_data_share` fails regardless of this setting. |
| `RequireMarketplaceEndpointCMK` | `true` | BR-40 | When `true`, a Bedrock Marketplace model endpoint without a customer-managed KMS key fails. BR-40 uses `kms:DescribeKey` and requires `KeyManager=CUSTOMER`; AWS-managed keys do not pass. When `false`, a missing or AWS-managed key is reported as an informational `N/A` hardening advisory. |
| `RequireAgentCoreOnlineEvaluation` | `false` | AC-17 | When `true`, missing or incomplete active AgentCore online evaluation coverage fails. When `false`, absent coverage is informational. |
| `AgentCoreTokenVaultId` | `default` | AC-14 | Selects the regional AgentCore Identity token vault whose customer-managed KMS encryption is assessed. |
| `ApprovedExternalAccountIds` | Empty | SM-30 | Comma-separated 12-digit AWS account IDs approved to receive SageMaker Model Registry access. Accounts outside the configured boundary fail. |
| `ApprovedOrganizationIds` | Empty | SM-30 | Comma-separated AWS Organizations IDs approved to receive SageMaker Model Registry access. Organizations outside the configured boundary fail. |

For the approved-account and approved-organization lists, do not include spaces.
Leaving both lists empty means SM-30 still detects public access, but external
sharing that cannot be compared with an explicit organizational boundary is
reported informationally.

When updating a stack with the AWS CLI, use a JSON parameter file for these
comma-separated values. The CLI shorthand syntax also uses commas as field
separators, so an unescaped `ParameterValue=111122223333,444455556666` is not
treated as one value.

Create `params.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "ParameterKey": "ApprovedExternalAccountIds",
    "ParameterValue": "111122223333,444455556666"
  },
  {
    "ParameterKey": "ApprovedOrganizationIds",
    "ParameterValue": "o-a1b2c3d4e5,o-f6g7h8i9j0"
  }
]
```

Then pass the file to the stack update:

```bash
aws cloudformation update-stack \
  --stack-name <stack-name> \
  --use-previous-template \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameters file://params.json
```

These parameters are available in both top-level deployment templates and both
direct SAM templates. CodeBuild passes the selected values to every deployed
assessment stack. Updating a value requires a CloudFormation stack update and a
new assessment run.

---

## Multi-Region Scanning

Both deployment modes support scanning multiple AWS regions in parallel via the `TargetRegions` parameter:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Empty (default) | Scans deployment region only — fully backward compatible |
| Comma- or space-separated (for example, `us-east-1,us-west-2` or `us-east-1 us-west-2`) | Scans those regions in parallel |
| `all` | Discovers and scans all regions where assessed services are available |

Scanning uses a Step Functions Map state, so multiple regions execute in parallel with no additional time cost. Services unavailable in a region produce an informational N/A finding.

The HTML report includes a Region column, filter dropdown, and "Risk by Region / Scope" summary.

> **Upgrading an existing deployment?** See [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#12-upgrading-an-existing-deployment-to-multi-region) — it's a simple stack parameter update with no teardown.

---

## How It Works

1. **Deploy** — CloudFormation creates CodeBuild, S3, IAM roles, and a Lambda trigger
2. **CodeBuild runs** — builds and deploys the SAM assessment stack (per account in multi-account mode)
3. **Step Functions execute** — orchestrates: S3 cleanup → IAM permission caching → resolve regions → Map state fans out per-region assessments (Bedrock, SageMaker, AgentCore in parallel) → optionally run Responsible AI GRC checks → optionally run OWASP Top 10 for LLM checks → generate consolidated report
4. **Results** — HTML and CSV reports are stored in your S3 bucket

### Optional: Responsible AI GRC Checks (`EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment`)

The 64 Responsible AI GRC (FS-XX) checks are **opt-in** and default
to `false`. Set the `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment` deployment parameter to `true`
when you want the additional Responsible AI GRC assessment. When
enabled, the Responsible AI GRC assessment Lambda runs and its findings appear in a
dedicated **Responsible AI GRC** section of the HTML report. When left `false`,
no Responsible AI GRC findings are produced and the report omits that section
entirely. The toggle is threaded into the Step Functions execution input
(`enableResponsibleAIGRC`); the Responsible AI GRC Lambda is always deployed but is invoked only
when the flag is `true`. A legacy `EnableFinServAssessment` parameter is also
available as an alias — see
[Responsible AI GRC alias migration guide](docs/RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC_ALIAS_MIGRATION.md).

> **Deployment path note.** The `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment` parameter is wired
> through the CodeBuild-based deployment templates
> (`deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml` and
> `deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml`), which thread it into every Step
> Functions `start-execution` call as `enableResponsibleAIGRC`. This is the supported
> install path. If you instead deploy `aiml-security-assessment/template.yaml`
> directly with `sam deploy` and start executions yourself, the state machine has
> no built-in trigger, so Responsible AI GRC checks stay **off** unless you include
> `"enableResponsibleAIGRC": "true"` in the execution input you pass to `StartExecution`.

### Optional: OWASP Top 10 for LLM Checks (`EnableOWASPAssessment`)

The 12 OWASP Top 10 for LLM (OW-XX) checks are **opt-in** and default to
`false`. Set the `EnableOWASPAssessment` deployment parameter to `true` when
you want the additional compliance-standard assessment. When enabled, the OWASP
Lambda runs per region after the Bedrock/SageMaker/AgentCore/Responsible AI GRC Lambdas
complete: it reads each service's per-region CSV, applies mapping rules to emit
OW-01..OW-10 rows derived from existing findings, and runs two net-new checks
for LLM07 (System Prompt Leakage). Findings appear in a new **"By Compliance
Standard"** sidebar section of the HTML report. When left `false`, no OWASP
findings are produced and the section is omitted entirely. The toggle is
threaded into the Step Functions execution input (`enableOWASP`); the OWASP
Lambda is always deployed but is invoked only when the flag is `true`.

> **OWASP → Responsible AI GRC dependency (transparent to users).** Roughly
> two-thirds of the OWASP mapping rows — including all of LLM05 (Improper
> Output Handling) — derive from the Responsible AI GRC (FS-XX) checks. To
> guarantee **full** OWASP coverage, the state machine automatically runs the
> Responsible AI GRC Lambda whenever `EnableOWASPAssessment=true`, even when
> `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment=false`. When the customer did not enable
> Responsible AI GRC explicitly, its findings are used only to power the
> OW-XX mappings, are **hidden from the report UI** — no Responsible AI GRC
> nav item, service card, or section appears — and the raw
> `responsible_ai_grc_security_report_*.csv` is not copied to the
> customer-facing report bucket. Setting both flags to `true` surfaces the
> Responsible AI GRC section and CSV normally.

The "By Compliance Standard" section is **extensible**: adding NIST AI RMF (`EnableNISTAssessment`) or EU AI Act (`EnableEUAIActAssessment`) later follows the same pattern.

#### Scope and limitations

- **Responsible AI GRC Region scope.** Core Bedrock, SageMaker, and AgentCore checks run per target region. Responsible AI GRC runs once per account; evidence without explicit regional provenance is labeled `Global` rather than copied into every target region. Regions confirmed to have no relevant GenAI resources receive an explicit regional `FS-00`/`N/A` row.
- **Heuristic and advisory checks.** Some controls cannot be verified through an API (application-layer controls, dataset contents, resource associations); these are reported as `ADVISORY`/`N/A` and require manual review. See [How finding severities are determined](#how-finding-severities-are-determined).
- **Permissions.** A check that lacks an IAM permission is reported as `COULD NOT ASSESS` (not a failure). Re-deploy the member role after any IAM template change so newer actions take effect.

For detailed architecture, execution flow, and extension guidance, see the [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).

## Viewing Results

1. Open your **infrastructure stack** in CloudFormation → **Outputs** tab → copy `AssessmentBucket`
2. Navigate to that S3 bucket
3. For single-account, open `{account_id}/security_assessment_single_account_*.html`
4. For multi-account, open `consolidated-reports/security_assessment_multi_account_*.html`

### Assessment Execution Process

#### Automatic Trigger

- The AWS CodeBuild project starts automatically after central stack creation
- An AWS Lambda trigger function initiates the assessment workflow

#### Multi-Account Orchestration

1. **Account Discovery**: AWS CodeBuild queries AWS Organizations for active accounts
2. **Role Assumption**: Assumes `AIMLSecurityMemberRole` in each target account
3. **Module Deployment**: Deploys the AI/ML assessment module:

   - Amazon Bedrock Assessment AWS Lambda
   - Amazon SageMaker AI Assessment AWS Lambda
   - Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Assessment AWS Lambda
   - Responsible AI GRC Assessment AWS Lambda
   - OWASP Top 10 for LLM Assessment AWS Lambda
   - AWS IAM Permission Caching AWS Lambda
   - Consolidated Report Generation AWS Lambda

4. **Assessment Execution**: AWS Step Functions orchestrate parallel AWS Lambda execution
5. **Results Collection**: Individual AWS Lambda functions store results in local Amazon S3 buckets
6. **Consolidation**: AWS CodeBuild collects and consolidates results from all accounts
7. **Reporting**: Generates multi-account HTML and CSV reports
8. **Notification**: Sends completion notification through Amazon SNS (if configured)

## Monitoring and Results

- **Amazon S3 Bucket**: Central storage for all assessment results
- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**: AWS CodeBuild execution logs
- **Amazon SNS Notifications**: Email alerts on completion/failure
- **Amazon EventBridge Rules**: Automated workflow triggers

You can check the AWS CodeBuild console to confirm the assessment completed successfully before accessing the results.

### Accessing Results

1. **Find the Amazon S3 Bucket Name**:

   - Navigate to **AWS CloudFormation** > **Stacks** in the AWS Console
   - For single-account deployments using the standalone template (`aiml-security-single-account.yaml`), select the stack you deployed (for example, `aiml-security-single-account`) and find the `AssessmentBucket` output. Results are synced to this bucket under the `{account_id}/` prefix.
   - For multi-account deployments, select the `aiml-security-multi-account` stack created in [Step 2: Deploy Central Infrastructure](#step-2-deploy-central-infrastructure) and find the `AssessmentBucket` output
   - Go to the **Outputs** tab
   - Copy the Amazon S3 bucket name

   > **Note**: The deployment creates multiple Amazon S3 buckets. Only use the bucket from the `AssessmentBucket` output above. Other buckets (such as `aiml-sec-*-aimlassessmentbucket-*` from nested stacks or `aws-sam-cli-managed-*` for deployment artifacts) are for internal use and can be ignored.

2. **Navigate to the Amazon S3 Bucket**:

   - Go to **Amazon S3** in the AWS Console
   - Search for and open your assessment bucket
   - For single-account deployments, open the `{account_id}/` folder and then open the `security_assessment_single_account_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html` report
   - For multi-account deployments, follow the [Report Structure](#report-structure) guidance below

### Report Structure

#### Consolidated Reports

- **Location**: `consolidated-reports/` folder in the bucket

    only when `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment` is enabled)
  - `owasp_security_report_{execution_id}.csv` - OWASP Top 10 for LLM
    assessment results (12 OW-XX checks; present only when
    `EnableOWASPAssessment` is enabled)
  - `permissions_cache_{execution_id}.json` - IAM permissions cache
  - `security_assessment_single_account_{timestamp}.html` - Consolidated HTML report (same features as multi-account report)

### Understanding Results

| Severity | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **High** | Critical — immediate action required |
| **Medium** | Important — should be addressed |
| **Low** | Minor — best practice optimization |
| **Informational** | Advisory — no action required |

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Failed** | Security issue identified |
| **Passed** | Resource meets best practice |
| **N/A** | No resources to assess or service not available in region |

---

### How finding severities are determined

Responsible AI GRC (`FS-`) check severities are assigned by a documented, reproducible methodology rather than per-check intuition. Each control is scored on two axes — **Impact** (harm if the control is absent) and **Likelihood** (probability the adverse outcome occurs given the control is absent) — and the pair is mapped to a severity via a 3×3 matrix. The labels align with the **AWS Security Hub ASFF** severity scale, so findings can be forwarded to Security Hub with consistent severities:

| Label | ASFF normalized | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Informational | 0 | No actionable issue (control not applicable, advisory/manual-review, or could-not-assess context) |
| Low | 1–39 | Does not require action on its own; compensating controls exist |
| Medium | 40–69 | Should be addressed, but not urgently |
| High | 70–89 | Should be addressed as a priority |

Severity is a property of the **control** (its inherent risk), so a check's `Passed` and `Failed` rows carry the same severity. The `N/A` family is fixed by disposition: *not-applicable* and *advisory* findings are **Informational**; *could-not-assess* (access-denied / unsupported region) findings are **Low**. `Critical` is reserved and not currently emitted.

For the full methodology (matrix, factor definitions, disposition rules) and the authoritative per-finding assignments, see [Responsible AI GRC Severity Methodology](docs/SECURITY_CHECKS_RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC_SEVERITY_METHODOLOGY.md) and the [Responsible AI GRC Severity Register](docs/SECURITY_CHECKS_RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC_SEVERITY_REGISTER.md). Mappings are preliminary — validate with your MRM/Legal/Compliance teams before relying on them as audit evidence.

| Task | How |
| --- | --- |
| Add new accounts | Add to StackSet deployment targets |
| Modify permissions scope | Edit `1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml` |
| Adjust concurrency | Change `ConcurrentAccountScans` parameter |
| Add new service checks | See [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#adding-new-aiml-service-assessments) |

## Permissions Required

The deployment uses multiple IAM roles with different trust and permission boundaries. They are not all read-only.

- **`CodeBuildRole` / `MultiAccountCodeBuildRole`**: orchestration roles used by the infrastructure stack to clone the repo, build SAM, deploy/update the assessment stack, and start Step Functions executions. These roles require infrastructure-management permissions such as CloudFormation, Lambda, IAM, Step Functions, and S3 actions.
- **`AIMLSecurityMemberRole`**: role assumed in the target account during single-account and multi-account runs. In the multi-account flow this role is also **not read-only**. It needs both service-read permissions for the checks and deployment permissions so CodeBuild can create or update the per-account SAM assessment stack.
- **SAM-created Lambda execution roles**: runtime roles for the assessment functions. These are the closest thing to read-only assessment roles. They primarily use `List*`, `Describe*`, and `Get*` access against Bedrock, SageMaker, AgentCore, IAM analysis APIs, and supporting read APIs, plus S3 access to write reports and read the cached IAM permissions file.

If you need to reduce scope, review the role policies in:

- [deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml](deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml)
- [deployment/1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml](deployment/1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml)
- [deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml](deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml)
- [aiml-security-assessment/template.yaml](aiml-security-assessment/template.yaml)
- [aiml-security-assessment/template-multi-account.yaml](aiml-security-assessment/template-multi-account.yaml)
