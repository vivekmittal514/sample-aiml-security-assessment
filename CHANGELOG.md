Changes are accumulated under **Unreleased** as they are merged. Creating a
release is not required for every change. When a version is tagged, move its
entries into a dated version section and create a new empty **Unreleased**
section.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added AWS Agent Registry as an independent assessment area with its own
  regional Lambda, Step Functions branch, CSV artifact, and HTML report area
  (including a dashboard summary tile and assessment-scope chip), plus an
  `AR-00` through `AR-08` check namespace covering IAM full access, IAM stale
  access, publication approval governance, discovery authorization,
  customer-managed KMS encryption, organization auto-detection, record
  lifecycle governance, and record provenance. Behavior worth knowing:
  - `AR-01` and `AR-02` evaluate attached and inline policies whose
    `Statement` is either a single object or a list. `AR-02` uses IAM
    service-last-accessed data: access older than 60 days fails, while IAM job
    errors and deadlines stay visible as indeterminate `N/A` rows.
  - Record inventory is bounded to 1,000 records and paginates within the
    Lambda deadline. A truncation or deadline notice is reported as an
    additional `N/A`/Informational row and does not discard the records
    already assessed.
  - Absent optional service metadata — approval configuration, discovery
    authorizer, auto-detection, creator attribution, and provenance source
    type — is reported as indeterminate `N/A` rather than as a failure, and an
    unrecognized authorizer type is reported as unsupported instead of as a
    reviewed JWT configuration. Auto-detected records must carry
    `DETECTED_FROM` lineage naming an AgentCore runtime or gateway matching
    the declared source type.
  - Discovery authorization and record lifecycle states are reported as
    informational evidence requiring review rather than as passes.
  - Registries in regions the account has not enabled are reported as
    unavailable, and client initialization or API failures become incomplete
    assessments with error-specific remediation. A single failing check
    produces an incomplete `N/A` row while the regional CSV is still written;
    an unrecoverable CSV-generation or S3-write failure raises so Step
    Functions records the failed task instead of treating a returned
    `statusCode: 500` payload as success.
- Added Agentic AI Security mappings `AG-33` through `AG-38`, derived from the
  new `AR-03` through `AR-08` controls. The catalog now contains 208 checks
  (94 core, 38 Agentic AI, 64 Responsible AI GRC, and 12 OWASP). Agent
  Registry findings are deliberately outside OWASP scope — the `AR-*` controls
  establish Registry governance but do not directly prove an OWASP
  LLM01–LLM10 control — so enabling OWASP does not change Registry counts.
- Added configurable `RequireAgentRegistryManualApproval` and
  `RequireAgentRegistryCMK` deployment baselines. Both are advisory by
  default, so a registry that auto-approves submitted records or uses the AWS
  owned encryption key is reported as informational, and remediation guidance
  is shown only when the baseline requires the control.
- Added SDK contract, IAM coverage, baseline-wiring, registry inventory,
  error-path, and finding-behavior tests, including pass/fail (or advisory
  `N/A`), no-resource, and access-denied coverage for `AR-01` and `AR-04`
  through `AR-07`.

### Changed

- Hardened assessment deployment roles. `AIMLSecurityMemberRole` now contains
  only cross-account deployment, Step Functions polling, and report-retrieval
  permissions; assessment APIs remain exclusively on the SAM-created Lambda
  execution roles. CodeBuild roles now scope Lambda, IAM, S3, and `PassRole`
  access to assessment resources, restrict `PassRole` to Lambda and Step
  Functions, remove stale Lambda/S3 administration actions, and no longer
  define unused local member roles. SAM runtime roles now use exact,
  prefix-scoped S3 artifact permissions instead of bucket-wide
  `S3CrudPolicy`, and remove stale IAM, SageMaker, GuardDuty, AgentCore, ECR,
  Logs, EC2, Lambda, ECS, CloudTrail, and S3 actions. The IAM permission-cache
  Lambda retains only the identity and policy reads it actually performs.
  Per-resource reads are ARN-scoped wherever the AWS service supports it;
  account-level enumeration APIs that do not support resource-level
  authorization (`bedrock:ListGuardrails`, `bedrock:ListPrompts`,
  `bedrock:ListAutomatedReasoningPolicies`, `sagemaker:ListPipelineExecutions`)
  remain on `Resource: "*"` so their checks are not silently denied.
  IAM service-last-access job creation is limited to roles and users in the
  assessed account using partition-aware principal ARNs, and AgentCore metric
  publication is constrained to the `AIMLSecurity/AgentCore` CloudWatch
  namespace.
- Standardized all AWS SDK dependencies on exact `boto3==1.43.85` and
  `botocore==1.43.85` pins.
- Narrowed `AC-02` wildcard findings and `AC-03` stale-access discovery to the
  `bedrock-agentcore` IAM namespace. Overly permissive `agent-registry` grants
  are now reported by `AR-01` and `AR-02`.
- Added end-user guidance for determining whether an upgrade requires only a
  CodeBuild run, a top-level infrastructure stack update, or a multi-account
  member-role StackSet update.
- Clarified that the provided deployment is validated and supported only in
  the standard AWS commercial partition. The README, developer guide,
  troubleshooting guidance, and `TargetRegions` parameter descriptions now
  state that partition-aware implementation details do not establish support
  for AWS GovCloud (US) or AWS China.
- Updated the screenshot capture tool to enforce the repository-root `.venv`,
  install its optional Python dependencies when missing, and verify a
  venv-local Playwright Chromium browser before capturing screenshots. Capture
  height now expands dynamically so every left-navigation section is visible.

### Fixed

- Classify Bedrock access-denied results and AgentCore check execution errors
  as incomplete informational `N/A` findings instead of security failures.
  AgentCore now records unexpected errors under each affected `AC-*` or
  `AG-*` control ID, preserves valid findings collected before an error, and
  does not emit a compliant pass when a cached IAM policy cannot be parsed.
  Confirmed workload misconfigurations remain scored failures.
- Treat a missing, unreadable, or malformed IAM permissions cache as an
  incomplete assessment prerequisite instead of replacing it with empty role
  and user collections. Bedrock, SageMaker, AgentCore, and Responsible AI GRC
  cache-dependent controls now emit explicit informational `N/A` rows rather
  than false passes or ambiguous “no permissions” results, while independent
  service checks continue running.
- Correct IAM remediation guidance across Bedrock, AgentCore, Responsible AI
  GRC, and derived OWASP findings. Bedrock model allowlists now use valid
  model and inference-profile ARN scoping instead of the nonexistent
  `bedrock:ModelId` condition key; BR-15 lists every Organizations permission
  it calls; AC-09 documents the exact service-linked-role creation permission
  and condition; AC-11 lists the complete KMS permissions and constraints for
  policy-engine encryption; and FS-27 directs operators to redeploy the
  SAM-created Lambda execution role through CodeBuild instead of changing the
  multi-account member role. Agent Registry stale-access errors no longer
  recommend granting `sts:GetCallerIdentity`, which requires no IAM Allow.
- Correct Bedrock Agents, Flows, Knowledge Bases, and Prompt Management
  remediation guidance to use the valid `bedrock:` IAM namespace instead of
  the `bedrock-agent` boto3 client name.
- Flag wildcard-resource `bedrock:TagResource` and `bedrock:UntagResource`
  grants in FS-22 when reviewing Bedrock Knowledge Base IAM policies.
- Recover assessment deployment stacks in `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` or
  `DELETE_FAILED` before rerunning SAM deployment. The build now performs this
  recovery for member-account, multi-account management, and single-account
  paths, using narrowly scoped `cloudformation:DeleteStack` permissions for
  assessment and SAM-managed stacks.
- Fail multi-account CodeBuild runs when any expected account cannot deploy,
  start or complete its Step Functions execution, expose its assessment
  bucket, or produce and upload the current execution's required CSV and HTML
  artifacts. The separately launched management-account assessment is always
  included in the expected set, including when `MultiAccountListOverride`
  contains only member accounts. Healthy accounts still complete and upload
  their individual results, but a consolidated report is withheld when
  coverage is incomplete, and the build prints every affected account, stage,
  and reason before exiting unsuccessfully.
- Fail report generation when HTML rendering or S3 upload raises an exception,
  so Step Functions and CodeBuild cannot treat an uploaded error page as a
  successful assessment report. Before rendering, the report Lambda also
  requires a non-empty execution-scoped CSV from every regional service in
  every resolved target region, plus the one-time Responsible AI GRC artifact
  whenever that assessment or OWASP is enabled. The execution-scoped IAM
  permissions cache is still removed on both successful and failed
  report-generation attempts.
- Stop OWASP inventory pagination when an AWS API repeats a continuation token,
  preventing OW-11 or OW-12 from looping until the Lambda timeout.
- Include AWS Agent Registry in `TargetRegions=all` discovery and use the
  deployment partition's region catalog when AgentCore or Agent Registry
  endpoint metadata does not enumerate regions.
- Restore `bedrock-agentcore:GetTokenVault` on `Resource: "*"` for AC-14.
  Although the service reference documents a token-vault resource type, the
  runtime authorization request is evaluated against `"*"`. The scoped policy
  therefore returned access denied and silently changed a failed token-vault
  customer-managed-KMS check into informational `N/A`; the Agentic AI and
  OWASP findings derived from AC-14 now receive the real result again.
- Restore CodeBuild and cross-account member-role access to start and poll the
  SAM-generated `AIMLAssessmentStateMachine-*` state machines. The
  least-privilege policies now explicitly include the generated state-machine
  and execution ARN patterns without widening access to unrelated workflows.
- Restore `lambda:ListFunctions` to the Bedrock assessment Lambda role so
  BR-33 can inventory Bedrock-related Lambda functions before checking Amazon
  Inspector code-scanning status, instead of reporting an access-denied
  assessment as informational `N/A`.
- Permit the AgentCore service-linked-role check to return the intended missing
  role finding by authorizing `iam:GetRole` for both the root-path lookup ARN
  and the service-linked-role ARN.
- Keep Bedrock, SageMaker, AgentCore, and Agent Registry stale-access checks
  running when an incomplete or malformed STS caller ARN is returned by
  falling back safely to the standard AWS partition.
- Prevented `FS-22` from flagging assessment-created roles solely for Bedrock
  inventory APIs that AWS requires to use `Resource: "*"`. It still flags
  wildcard Bedrock actions and exact Bedrock actions with supported resource
  scoping that remain unscoped. Corrected the FS-22 action catalog so
  non-scopable query actions do not create false positives and actions with
  supported Bedrock resource scoping—including data-source, association,
  resource-policy, tag, and log-delivery actions—remain covered; remediation
  now identifies the supported resource ARN(s)
  instead of incorrectly prescribing a Knowledge Base ARN for every action.
- Calculate report pass rates from unique direct-service controls instead of
  resource-row counts: any failed assessable row fails its `Check_ID`, controls
  pass only when all assessable rows pass, and N/A rows are excluded.
- Stop `AC-03` IAM last-access polling before the Lambda timeout, preserve
  completed results with an explicit incomplete-assessment row, and classify
  IAM job timeouts as indeterminate instead of failed controls.
- Require `AC-03` candidate permissions to come from attached or inline policy
  documents instead of inferring access from attached-policy names.
- Evaluate attached customer-managed IAM policy documents as well as inline
  policies in `AC-02` and `AC-03`, and score `Allow`/`NotAction` allow-except
  policies only when their exclusions name the AgentCore namespace without
  fully covering it, so an administrator-style grant is treated the same
  whether it is written as `Action: "*"` or as `NotAction`.
- Preserve case-insensitive IAM wildcard matching while supporting embedded and
  partial wildcard action patterns.
- Report AgentCore as unavailable in regions the account has not enabled. A
  missing regional endpoint and the credential-shaped codes AWS returns for a
  disabled region (`UnrecognizedClientException`, `InvalidClientTokenId`,
  `AuthFailure`) are classified as regional unavailability, so scanning all
  partition regions no longer produces per-region rows advising operators to
  troubleshoot DNS, VPC routing, or credentials. Genuinely expired or malformed
  credentials (`ExpiredToken`, `SignatureDoesNotMatch`) and other API failures
  remain incomplete assessments with credential- or error-specific
  remediation.
- Backfill deadline-skipped AgentCore and Agentic AI checks before writing the
  regional CSV so an approaching timeout no longer drops controls from the
  report.
- Make screenshot capture failures, including clipped-sidebar guard failures,
  terminate the capture tool with a non-zero exit status.

### Deployment impact

Apply these updates in order.

1. **Multi-account member-role StackSet update required first** because
   `deployment/1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml` changed. It creates the
   member-role customer-managed deployment policy and narrows
   `AIMLSecurityMemberRole` to deployment, execution-polling, and
   report-retrieval operations, including narrowly scoped recovery of failed
   assessment or SAM-managed stacks; assessment service API permissions remain
   on SAM Lambda execution roles.
2. **Multi-account central infrastructure update required next** because
   `deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml` changed with the AWS Agent
   Registry baselines, least-privilege CodeBuild deployment policy, and
   narrowly scoped failed-stack recovery. This update also removes the obsolete
   conditional local member-role resource if an older stack still tracks it.
3. **Single-account infrastructure update required** because
   `deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml` changed with the same
   baselines, CodeBuild policy hardening, and failed-stack recovery. This
   update also removes the obsolete local member-role resource if an older
   stack still tracks it.
4. **CodeBuild run required last** to deploy the updated assessment code,
   dependencies, `buildspec.yml`, and AWS SAM templates
   (`aiml-security-assessment/template.yaml` and
   `aiml-security-assessment/template-multi-account.yaml`). The updated
   buildspec also makes incomplete multi-account coverage fail the run instead
   of publishing an apparently complete consolidated report, and report
   rendering or upload failures now fail the Step Functions execution. The SAM
   templates create the standalone AWS Agent Registry assessment Lambda and
   update the state machine.

Deployments pinned to a tag or commit must update the `GitHubBranch`
CloudFormation parameter to the revision containing these changes before
starting CodeBuild.
