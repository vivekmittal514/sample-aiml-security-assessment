## Common Issues

### 1. AWS CloudFormation StackSet Deployment Failures

**Symptoms:** StackSet instances fail to create in member accounts.

**Solutions:**

- Check that service-linked roles exist for AWS CloudFormation StackSets
- Verify the account running the central CodeBuild project has AWS Organizations permissions, if it is discovering accounts automatically
- Verify target OUs contain active accounts
- Review the StackSet operation history for specific error messages

### 2. Cross-Account Role Assumption Failures

**Symptoms:** "Access Denied" errors when assuming roles in member accounts.

**Solutions:**

- Verify the `AIMLSecurityMemberRole` exists in target accounts
- Check the trust relationship allows the central CodeBuild role
- Confirm the `ManagementAccountID` parameter matches the account where the central `MultiAccountCodeBuildRole` runs
- Verify the StackSet deployment completed successfully in all accounts

### 3. AWS SAM Deployment Failures

**Symptoms:** CodeBuild fails during the SAM deploy phase.

**Solutions:**

- Check CodeBuild logs in CloudWatch for specific errors
- Verify the GitHub repository URL and `GitHubBranch` parameter point to a branch, tag, or commit that CodeBuild can clone
- Verify the S3 bucket for SAM artifacts exists and is accessible. If the `aws-sam-cli-managed-default` stack is stuck in `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` or `DELETE_FAILED`, delete it and re-run CodeBuild
- Look for IAM permission errors in the logs
- Check if a previous deployment left orphaned resources
- Check whether `TARGET_REGIONS` failed validation. It must be empty, `all`, or a comma- or space-separated list such as `us-east-1,us-west-2` or `us-east-1 us-west-2`

### 4. AWS Step Functions Execution Failures

**Symptoms:** AWS Step Functions show failed state or timeout.

**Solutions:**

- Monitor state machine executions in each account
- Check Lambda function logs for errors
- Verify Lambda has sufficient timeout. Most assessment Lambdas default to 10 minutes; Responsible AI GRC has its own timeout in the SAM templates
- Verify AWS IAM permissions allow Lambda to access required services
- In multi-region scans, review each region's Map state iteration. A single service branch can be marked incomplete while the state machine still generates a report for the remaining services and regions

### 5. EarlyValidation::ResourceExistenceCheck Error

**Symptoms:** CloudFormation blocks stack creation with this error.

**Cause:** A resource with the same physical name already exists outside of CloudFormation management, typically from a failed deployment.

**Solution:**
The versioned bucket cleanup command requires `jq`.

```bash
# Find likely orphaned buckets
aws s3 ls | grep aiml-security

BUCKET_NAME="<bucket-name>"

aws s3 rm "s3://${BUCKET_NAME}" --recursive

while true; do
  delete_payload=$(aws s3api list-object-versions \
    --bucket "${BUCKET_NAME}" \
    --output json \
    | jq '{Objects: (((.Versions // []) + (.DeleteMarkers // [])) | map({Key, VersionId}) | .[0:1000])}')

  object_count=$(echo "${delete_payload}" | jq '.Objects | length')
  if [ "${object_count}" -eq 0 ]; then
    break
  fi

  aws s3api delete-objects \
    --bucket "${BUCKET_NAME}" \
    --delete "${delete_payload}"
done

aws s3 rb "s3://${BUCKET_NAME}"

# Re-run the CodeBuild project
```

### 6. Responsible AI GRC Checks Do Not Appear in the Report

**Symptoms:** The report does not include the **Responsible AI GRC** section or
any `FS-` findings.

> **Note on names.** The capability is displayed as, and its machine identifiers
> are named, **Responsible AI GRC**: the `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment`
> parameter, the `ENABLE_RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC` environment variable, the
> `enableResponsibleAIGRC` execution input, the `ResponsibleAIGRCAssessmentFunction`
> logical ID, the `aiml-security-<stack>-RAIGRCAssessment` Lambda, the four Step
> Functions states `Responsible AI GRC Enabled?`, `Responsible AI GRC Security
> Assessment`, `Responsible AI GRC Assessment Incomplete`, and `Responsible AI
> GRC Assessment Skipped`, the `$.responsibleAIGRCError` result path, the
> `responsible-ai-grc` report slug with its `#responsible-ai-grc` anchor, and
> `responsible_ai_grc_security_report_*.csv`. A legacy `EnableFinServAssessment`
> CloudFormation parameter / `ENABLE_FINSERV` CodeBuild environment variable is
> also accepted and resolved into the primary name by `buildspec.yml` — see
> [Responsible AI GRC alias migration guide](RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC_ALIAS_MIGRATION.md).
> That alias stops there: the Step Functions execution input only ever carries
> `"enableResponsibleAIGRC"`, never a legacy `"enableFinServ"` key. See problem 6b
> below if you start Step Functions directly with the old key.

**Expected when OWASP-only:** If `EnableOWASPAssessment=true` and
`EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment=false`, the `FS-*` assessment still runs as an
OWASP source dependency, but the Responsible AI GRC section, `FS-` rows, and
`responsible_ai_grc_security_report_*.csv` are intentionally omitted from the
customer-facing report bucket.

**Solutions:**

- Confirm the infrastructure stack parameter `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment`
  is set to `true`
- Confirm CodeBuild logs show `Responsible AI GRC assessment enabled is true`
- If you updated an existing deployment, re-run the CodeBuild project after the
  CloudFormation update completes. The parameter is passed to the Step Functions
  execution input when CodeBuild starts the assessment.
- Use the CodeBuild-based deployment templates for normal operation. If you
  deploy the SAM template directly and start Step Functions manually, include
  `"enableResponsibleAIGRC": "true"` in the `StartExecution` input.
- Check the Step Functions execution for the `Responsible AI GRC Enabled?`
  choice state and `Responsible AI GRC Security Assessment` task.

### 6b. Execution Fails Immediately with `LegacyEnableFinServInputRejected`

**Symptoms:** The Step Functions execution fails immediately (every region and
every service — Bedrock, SageMaker, AgentCore, OWASP, and Responsible AI GRC —
shows no findings), and the execution's error is
`LegacyEnableFinServInputRejected`.

**Cause:** The `StartExecution` input included `"enableFinServ": "true"`
directly. This key was the original (pre-rebrand) execution-input name. It is
not accepted at the Step Functions layer — only `EnableFinServAssessment` /
`ENABLE_FINSERV` at the CloudFormation-parameter / CodeBuild-environment-variable
layer are retained as a legacy alias, and `buildspec.yml` resolves that alias
into `"enableResponsibleAIGRC"` before ever calling `StartExecution`. This
failure can only happen if something calls `StartExecution` directly, bypassing
CodeBuild and `buildspec.yml` entirely — for example a hand-written script, an
old runbook, or a direct AWS CLI/SDK call using the pre-rebrand input shape.

This is a deliberate, hard failure rather than a silent skip: an execution that
used the old key would otherwise complete successfully but quietly report no
Responsible AI GRC findings, which is worse than a visible error.

**Solutions:**

- Replace `"enableFinServ": "true"` with `"enableResponsibleAIGRC": "true"` in
  whatever is calling `StartExecution` directly.
- If you deploy and start assessments through the provided CodeBuild templates
  (`deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml`,
  `deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml`), you are not affected — CodeBuild
  never passes `enableFinServ` to `StartExecution`, only the resolved
  `enableResponsibleAIGRC` value.

### 7. TargetRegions Validation or Unexpected Region Coverage

**Symptoms:** CodeBuild fails with a `TARGET_REGIONS` validation error, or the report scans fewer or different regions than expected.

**Solutions:**

- Leave `TargetRegions` empty to scan only the deployment region
- Use `all` to scan the union of regions returned by boto3 for Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
- Use a comma- or space-separated list, such as `us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1` or `us-east-1 us-west-2 eu-west-1`. The deployment normalizes the value before passing it to SAM
- Confirm the services being assessed are available in each target region. If a service is unavailable or has no resources in a region, the report can show `N/A` or no resource-specific findings for that service and region
- Confirm the account is opted in to any opt-in regions you include

### 8. CodeBuild Source or GitHub Branch Failures

**Symptoms:** CodeBuild fails before SAM build, or the logs show repository clone/source errors.

**Solutions:**

- Confirm `GitHubRepoUrl` is reachable by CodeBuild
- Confirm `GitHubBranch` is a valid branch, tag, or commit
- If you use a fork or feature branch, make sure the infrastructure stack points at that branch before starting CodeBuild
- For private repositories, configure CodeBuild source credentials before deployment or use a source location CodeBuild can access

### 9. CodeBuild Timeout or Out-of-Memory with Many Accounts

**Symptoms:** CodeBuild job times out or runs slowly when scanning a large number of accounts concurrently.

**Cause:** The `ConcurrentAccountScans` parameter controls both the number of parallel account scans and the CodeBuild compute type. Higher concurrency requires a larger (and more expensive) instance:

| ConcurrentAccountScans | Parallel Accounts | CodeBuild Compute Type | Approximate Cost per Build Minute |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Three (default) | 3 | `BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL` | $0.005 |
| Six | 6 | `BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM` | $0.01 |
| Twelve | 12 | `BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE` | $0.02 |

**Solutions:**

- For organizations with fewer than 10 accounts, the default "Three" is usually sufficient
- If builds timeout, increase `ConcurrentAccountScans` to process more accounts in parallel -- but be aware this also increases the per-minute CodeBuild cost
- If builds timeout even at "Twelve," increase the `CodeBuildTimeout` parameter (default is 300 minutes for multi-account)
- For very large organizations (100+ accounts), consider using `MultiAccountListOverride` to split assessments into batches. It accepts comma- or space-separated account IDs

### 10. No Reports in S3 Bucket

**Symptoms:** Assessment completes but no HTML/CSV files appear.

**Solutions:**

1. **Wrong bucket**: Use the bucket from the **Infrastructure Stack** outputs,
   not the assessment stack.
2. **Still running**: Check CodeBuild console. Multi-region, multi-account, or
   Responsible AI GRC-enabled assessments can take longer than a single-region run.
3. **Wrong prefix**: Look under `{account_id}/` for per-account reports and
   `consolidated-reports/` for the multi-account consolidated HTML report.
4. **Post-build copy failed**: In multi-account mode, CodeBuild copies CSV/HTML
   files from each account's SAM assessment bucket into the central
   infrastructure bucket. Search CodeBuild logs for `Copying files from`,
   `Failed to list bucket contents`, or `No files to copy`.
5. **Permissions**: Check CloudWatch Logs for Lambda execution errors and
   CodeBuild logs for S3 sync errors.

**Note:** If OWASP is enabled and Responsible AI GRC is disabled, absence of
`responsible_ai_grc_security_report_*.csv` in the report bucket is expected. The
internal SAM assessment bucket may still contain Responsible AI GRC source
artifacts created during the run; use the infrastructure stack's report bucket
for customer-facing results.

### 11. Confused by Multiple CloudFormation Stacks

**Symptoms:** You see multiple stacks and aren't sure which one has your results.

**Explanation:** The deployment creates an infrastructure stack and one or more SAM assessment stacks. The infrastructure stack is the user-facing stack for report access.

| Stack Type | How to Identify | What to Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Infrastructure Stack** (yours) | The name you chose (for example, `aiml-security-single-account`) | Use this — go to Outputs tab, copy `AssessmentBucket` |
| **Assessment Stack** (auto-generated) | `aiml-sec-{account_id}` (single), `aiml-security-{account_id}` (multi), or `aiml-security-mgmt` | Internal execution stack. Its `AssessmentBucketName` output is useful for debugging raw per-account reports and retained buckets |

**Quick Check**: If a stack name starts with `aiml-sec-` or `aiml-security-` followed by numbers (or `aiml-security-mgmt`), it's auto-generated. Look for the name you chose during deployment.

### 12. Upgrading an Existing Deployment to Multi-Region

**Symptoms:** You have an existing single-region deployment and want to enable multi-region scanning.

**Solution:** Update your existing CloudFormation stack — no teardown required.

1. Navigate to **AWS CloudFormation** > **Stacks**
2. Select your infrastructure stack (for example, `aiml-security-single-account` or `aiml-security-multi-account`)
3. Click **Update** > **Use current template**
4. Set the `TargetRegions` parameter (for example, `us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1`, `us-east-1 us-west-2 eu-west-1`, or `all`)
5. Click through to **Submit**
6. The next assessment run will scan the specified regions in parallel

**What happens during the upgrade:**

- CloudFormation updates the `TARGET_REGIONS` environment variable on the CodeBuild project in the infrastructure stack
- On the next CodeBuild run, SAM deploy updates the assessment stack and passes the new `TargetRegions` value into the assessment Lambdas and state machine
- The Step Functions `Resolve Target Regions` state resolves the region list, then the Map state scans those regions in parallel
- No data is lost — the S3 bucket retains all previous reports
- Fully backward compatible — leaving `TargetRegions` empty preserves single-region behavior

---

## Upgrading to a New Release

Update only the deployment layers changed by the release. For a code-only fix,
re-running CodeBuild is normally sufficient because it pulls the configured
source revision and updates the AWS SAM assessment stack. CodeBuild cannot,
however, update the top-level infrastructure stack or the multi-account
member-role StackSet.

Do not delete the existing stacks. Update them in place so existing report
buckets, configuration, and stack identities are retained.

### Determine the required upgrade actions

Use the following path-to-action mapping:

| Changed path | Deployment action |
| --- | --- |
| `aiml-security-assessment/functions/**` or Lambda `requirements.txt` | Run CodeBuild to package and deploy the updated Lambda code |
| `aiml-security-assessment/statemachine/**` | Run CodeBuild to update the state machine through AWS SAM |
| `aiml-security-assessment/template.yaml` or `template-multi-account.yaml` | Run CodeBuild to update the corresponding AWS SAM assessment stack |
| `buildspec.yml` | Run CodeBuild so the build uses the updated orchestration |
| `consolidate_html_reports.py` | Run multi-account CodeBuild to apply the updated consolidator |
| `deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml` | Update the single-account infrastructure stack |
| `deployment/1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml` | Update the multi-account member-role StackSet before CodeBuild |
| `deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml` | Update the multi-account central infrastructure stack |
| Only `docs/**`, tests, examples, or `.github/**` | No deployed-resource update is required |

Check the root [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) first. Its `Unreleased` or
target-version `Deployment impact` section states which actions are required.
If the changelog does not cover the exact revisions being compared, compare the
commit used by the last successful build with the target tag or commit:

```bash
git diff --name-only <deployed-commit>..<target-tag-or-commit> -- \
  deployment/ \
  aiml-security-assessment/ \
  buildspec.yml \
  consolidate_html_reports.py
```

The CodeBuild build details expose the resolved source commit. Use that commit,
not a moving branch name such as `main`, as `<deployed-commit>`.

Interpret the comparison as follows:

- If only deployable source or AWS SAM files changed, run CodeBuild.
- If a top-level `deployment/*.yaml` file changed, update only the stack or
  StackSet associated with that file.
- If member-role and assessment files both changed, update the StackSet first,
  then run CodeBuild.
- If no deployable file changed, no AWS deployment is needed.

### Before upgrading

1. Review the changelog's deployment-impact section or compare the two
   revisions using the procedure above.
2. Choose the repository source revision to deploy. `GitHubBranch` accepts a
   branch, tag, or commit; an immutable release tag or commit is recommended.
3. Download only the templates that changed and are applicable to the
   deployment:

   | Deployment mode | Template to download when changed |
   | --- | --- |
   | Single account | `deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml` |
   | Multi-account | `deployment/1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml` and `deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml` |
   | Direct AWS SAM | `aiml-security-assessment/template.yaml` or `aiml-security-assessment/template-multi-account.yaml` |

4. Record the existing stack parameters and, for multi-account deployments, the
   StackSet deployment targets and regions.
5. Review new or changed IAM permissions before applying the templates.

### Single-account upgrade procedure

1. Determine whether `deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml` changed.
2. If it changed, open the existing user-created infrastructure stack in AWS
   CloudFormation and replace its template with the target release's version.
   This is the stack originally created from
   `deployment/aiml-security-single-account.yaml`, not the generated
   `aiml-sec-{account_id}` assessment stack.
3. If the template did not change but the deployment is pinned
   to an older tag or commit, update the stack using its current template and
   change only `GitHubRepoUrl` or `GitHubBranch` as needed.
4. Keep the remaining parameter values unless you intend to change the
   assessment configuration. Ensure `GitHubRepoUrl` and `GitHubBranch` point to
   the repository and release revision that match the uploaded template.
5. If performing a stack update, review the change set, acknowledge
   `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` when requested, apply it, and wait for
   `UPDATE_COMPLETE`.
6. If deployable source or AWS SAM files changed, open the CodeBuild project
   referenced by the infrastructure stack and manually start a build.
7. Verify that the build updates the existing `aiml-sec-{account_id}` AWS SAM
   stack and that the assessment finishes successfully. For documentation-only
   or test-only changes, no build is required.

### Multi-account upgrade procedure

Perform only the applicable steps. When member-role permissions changed, update
them before deploying assessment code:

1. Determine whether `deployment/1-aiml-security-member-roles.yaml` changed.
2. If it changed, update the existing member-role StackSet using the target
   release's template. Preserve `ManagementAccountID`, deployment targets,
   regions, and other settings, and apply the update to every currently
   targeted account and region.
3. If the StackSet was updated, wait for the operation and every StackSet
   instance to report success. Resolve failed or outdated instances before
   continuing.
4. Determine whether `deployment/2-aiml-security-codebuild.yaml` changed. If it
   changed, open the existing central infrastructure stack and replace its
   template with the target release's version.
5. If the central template did not change but the deployment is pinned to an
   older tag or commit, update the central stack using its current template and
   change only `GitHubRepoUrl` or `GitHubBranch` as needed.
6. Preserve all remaining parameters unless deliberately changing the deployment.
   Ensure `GitHubRepoUrl` and `GitHubBranch` match the same release used for the
   member-role and central templates.
7. If performing a central stack update, review the change set, acknowledge
   `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` when requested, apply it, and wait for
   `UPDATE_COMPLETE`.
8. If deployable source or AWS SAM files changed, manually start the central
   multi-account CodeBuild project.
9. Verify that CodeBuild can assume `AIMLSecurityMemberRole` in every target
   account, updates the existing `aiml-security-{account_id}` AWS SAM stacks
   (and `aiml-security-mgmt` when applicable), and completes the assessments.

This order is important. Update the member-role StackSet first when it changes,
then run CodeBuild so cross-account deployment, execution polling, and report
retrieval use the same release's role policy. Missing assessment API
permissions instead affect the SAM-created Lambda execution roles and can
appear as `N/A` or could-not-assess results.

### Direct AWS SAM deployment

If the assessment was deployed directly rather than through the supplied
top-level CloudFormation templates:

1. Check out or download the intended release.
2. Build the applicable `aiml-security-assessment/template.yaml` or
   `aiml-security-assessment/template-multi-account.yaml`.
3. Deploy it to the existing AWS SAM stack name, preserving all existing
   parameter values unless intentionally changing them.
4. Start the Step Functions assessment execution using the release's expected
   execution input.

Direct AWS SAM users are responsible for separately updating any external
cross-account roles or orchestration infrastructure they created.

### Why the build must be started manually

The `CodeBuildStartBuild` custom resource in both top-level infrastructure
templates starts CodeBuild only for a CloudFormation `Create` event. For
CloudFormation `Update` events it performs no action. Updating the
infrastructure template or `GitHubBranch` therefore does not itself launch a
build. Start CodeBuild manually only when the target revision contains
deployable assessment or orchestration changes.

### Post-upgrade verification

- Any infrastructure stack updated during the procedure is `UPDATE_COMPLETE`.
- If the multi-account StackSet was updated, all targeted instances are current
  and successful.
- The CodeBuild source revision is the intended branch, tag, or commit.
- If CodeBuild was required, it completed the AWS SAM deployment without IAM or
  role-assumption errors.
- If CodeBuild was required, the existing AWS SAM assessment stacks reached
  `CREATE_COMPLETE` or `UPDATE_COMPLETE`.
- If an assessment was run, a new report was written to the infrastructure
  stack's `AssessmentBucket` and contains the checks expected for the deployed
  release.

## Debugging

### Check CodeBuild Logs

1. Navigate to **AWS CodeBuild** > **Build projects**
2. Select your project (for example, `AIMLSecurityCodeBuild` or `AIMLSecurityMultiAccountCodeBuild`)
3. Click on the latest build
4. Review the **Build logs** tab for errors

### Verify Cross-Account Role Trust Policies

```bash
# In the member account, check the role trust policy
aws iam get-role --role-name AIMLSecurityMemberRole --query 'Role.AssumeRolePolicyDocument'
```

The trust policy should allow the central CodeBuild role:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<central-assessment-account-id>:root"
  },
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
  "Condition": {
    "ArnEquals": {
      "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::<central-assessment-account-id>:role/service-role/MultiAccountCodeBuildRole"
    }
  }
}
```

### Check S3 Bucket Permissions

The central infrastructure bucket is the user-facing report bucket. In multi-account mode, member accounts do not write directly to this bucket. CodeBuild assumes into each account, copies report files from that account's SAM assessment bucket, then uploads them to the central infrastructure bucket.

Verify the central bucket policy and CodeBuild S3 permissions if report upload fails:

```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <infrastructure-assessment-bucket-name>
```

If per-account reports are missing, also check the SAM assessment stack's `AssessmentBucketName` output for that account and confirm the files were created there.

### Monitor AWS Step Functions Executions

1. Navigate to **AWS Step Functions** in the target account
2. Find the `AIMLAssessmentStateMachine`
3. Review execution history for failures
4. Check individual Lambda invocation results

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Does this assessment make any changes to my AWS resources?**

A: The security checks do not modify your AI/ML workloads or data. They query resource configuration and write assessment artifacts to framework-owned S3 buckets.

The framework itself does create and manage its own deployment resources, including CloudFormation stacks, IAM roles, Lambda functions, Step Functions state machines, CodeBuild projects, S3 buckets, EventBridge rules, and optional SNS notifications. At the start of each assessment run, it removes current objects from its own SAM assessment bucket before writing new report artifacts. S3 version history and delete markers remain until removed manually; see the [Cleanup Guide](CLEANUP.md#emptying-and-deleting-versioned-s3-buckets).

**Q: How long does an assessment take to run?**

A:

- **Single account**: 5-10 minutes (depending on the number of resources)
- **Multi-account** (10 accounts): 15-20 minutes
- **Multi-account** (50+ accounts): 30-45 minutes

The assessment runs in parallel across accounts to minimize total execution time.

**Q: How often should I run security assessments?**

A:

- **Production AI/ML workloads**: Weekly or bi-weekly
- **Development/Test environments**: Monthly
- **After significant changes**: Always (new models, configuration changes, IAM updates)
- **Compliance requirements**: As mandated by your organization's security policies

You can automate regular assessments using Amazon EventBridge scheduled rules.

**Q: What AWS regions are supported?**

A: The framework is designed for standard AWS commercial regions where Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, or Amazon Bedrock AgentCore are available. Leave `TargetRegions` empty for the deployment region, set it to `all` to resolve the union of the regions reported for those three services, or provide an explicit comma- or space-separated list. AWS Agent Registry then runs in every selected region. AWS GovCloud and AWS China regions may require template modifications.

**Q: Does this work if I don't have any AI/ML resources deployed yet?**

A: Yes. The assessment runs successfully and reports findings with status "N/A" (Not Applicable) for checks where no resources exist to assess. This is useful for establishing a security baseline before deploying AI/ML workloads.

---

### Cost and Billing

**Q: How much does it cost to run this assessment?**

A: **Estimated cost per assessment**: $0.50 - $2.00 for typical single-account usage

Cost breakdown:

- **AWS Lambda**: $0.10 - $0.50 (pay per execution, typically 5-10 function invocations)
- **AWS Step Functions**: $0.05 - $0.25 (state transitions)
- **Amazon S3**: $0.01 - $0.10 (report storage, negligible for most use cases)
- **AWS CodeBuild**: $0.10 - $0.50 (execution time, billed per minute)

**Multi-account deployments**: AWS Lambda and AWS Step Functions costs scale with the number of accounts. AWS Organizations API calls are free. AWS CodeBuild cost depends on the `ConcurrentAccountScans` setting, which determines the instance size:

| ConcurrentAccountScans | CodeBuild Compute Type | Approximate Cost per Build Minute |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Three (default) | `BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL` | $0.005 |
| Six | `BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM` | $0.01 |
| Twelve | `BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE` | $0.02 |

For example, a 30-minute multi-account assessment at "Twelve" concurrency costs roughly $0.60 in CodeBuild alone, compared to $0.15 at the default "Three." Choose the concurrency level that balances speed against cost for your organization size.

**Q: Are there any ongoing costs when not running assessments?**

A: Minimal ongoing costs:

- **Amazon S3 storage**: $0.023 per GB/month for storing historical reports
- **AWS CloudWatch Logs**: $0.50 per GB for log retention (can be configured or disabled)
- All other resources (AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, AWS CodeBuild) are pay-per-use with **no idle costs**

---

### Customization and Configuration

**Q: Can I customize which security checks are included?**

A: Currently, all 94 core checks (40 Bedrock, 29 SageMaker AI, 17 AgentCore,
and 8 AWS Agent Registry) and 38 Agentic AI Security checks run by default to
provide comprehensive coverage. If `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment` is
enabled, the 64 optional Responsible AI GRC checks also run. If
`EnableOWASPAssessment` is enabled, the 12 optional OWASP Top 10 for LLM checks
run; Responsible AI GRC also runs as a hidden source dependency when OWASP
needs `FS-*` mappings, but its UI rows and raw CSV are omitted from the
customer-facing report bucket unless Responsible AI GRC is explicitly enabled.
You can filter results in the generated HTML reports by severity, status,
assessment area, governance framework, compliance standard, or region. Future
versions may support selective check execution.

**Q: Can I add custom security checks?**

A: Yes! See the [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#adding-new-aiml-service-assessments) for instructions on extending the framework with additional checks. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible.

**Q: Can I export results to other formats (JSON, CSV, SIEM)?**

A: Yes. The framework generates:

- **CSV files** for each service (available in the Amazon S3 bucket per account)
- **HTML reports** for interactive viewing
- **JSON** (available through the permissions cache and raw Lambda outputs)

You can integrate with SIEM tools by processing the CSV or JSON outputs from the Amazon S3 bucket.

**Q: Can I schedule automated assessments?**

A: Yes. Use Amazon EventBridge to trigger the AWS CodeBuild project on a schedule:

```bash
aws events put-rule \
  --name "WeeklyAIMLAssessment" \
  --schedule-expression "cron(0 2 ? * MON *)"

aws events put-targets \
  --rule "WeeklyAIMLAssessment" \
  --targets '[{
    "Id": "1",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:codebuild:<region>:<account-id>:project/<project-name>",
    "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<eventbridge-codebuild-start-role>"
  }]'
```

The target role must trust `events.amazonaws.com` and allow `codebuild:StartBuild` on the assessment CodeBuild project. For new schedules, Amazon EventBridge Scheduler is also a good option.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: The assessment completed but I don't see any reports in my Amazon S3 bucket.**

A: Common causes:

1. **Wrong bucket**: Verify you're looking at the bucket from the **Infrastructure Stack** outputs (not the assessment stack)
2. **Still running**: Check AWS CodeBuild console. Multi-region, multi-account, or Responsible AI GRC-enabled assessments can take longer than a single-region run
3. **Wrong prefix**: Look under `{account_id}/` for per-account reports and `consolidated-reports/` for the multi-account consolidated HTML report
4. **Post-build copy failed**: Search CodeBuild logs for `Copying files from`, `Failed to list bucket contents`, `No files to copy`, or S3 sync errors
5. **Permissions issue**: Check AWS CloudWatch Logs for Lambda errors and CodeBuild logs for S3 access errors

**Q: I see "Access Denied" errors in the AWS CodeBuild logs.**

A: This usually indicates:

1. **Multi-account**: The member role (`AIMLSecurityMemberRole`) is not deployed in target accounts through AWS CloudFormation StackSets
2. **Trust relationship**: The role trust policy doesn't allow the central AWS CodeBuild role to assume it
3. **Permissions**: The role lacks the deployment, execution-polling, or
   report-retrieval permission that CodeBuild needs

Solution: Verify AWS CloudFormation StackSet deployment in Step 1 completed
successfully across all target accounts. For Lambda `AccessDenied` errors,
review the relevant function's policy in both SAM templates instead.

**Q: The assessment is taking longer than expected.**

A: Performance factors:

- **Number of resources**: Accounts with hundreds of Amazon SageMaker notebooks or Amazon Bedrock models take longer
- **API throttling**: AWS API rate limits may slow down assessments in large environments
- **Concurrent executions**: Multi-account assessments run in parallel (configurable through the `ConcurrentAccountScans` parameter)
- **Region scope**: Multi-region scans multiply the amount of service inventory collected
- **Responsible AI GRC and OWASP checks**: Enabling `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment` adds the optional `FS-` checks; enabling `EnableOWASPAssessment` adds the optional `OW-` checks and may also run the `FS-*` assessment as a source dependency, increasing run time

If assessments consistently timeout, increase `CodeBuildTimeout`, reduce `TargetRegions`, reduce the account batch size with `MultiAccountListOverride`, or lower concurrency if throttling is the bottleneck. Lambda timeout changes require editing the SAM templates.

### Security and Compliance

**Q: Where is my assessment data stored?**

A: All assessment data remains **entirely within your AWS account**:

- Reports stored in **your Amazon S3 bucket** (you control retention and access)
- Logs in **your Amazon CloudWatch Logs** (configurable retention)
- No data is sent to external services or third parties

**Q: What IAM permissions does the framework need?**

A: The framework uses multiple roles, and only the Lambda runtime roles are close to read-only:

- **CodeBuild orchestration roles** (`CodeBuildRole`, `MultiAccountCodeBuildRole`) need deployment permissions to build SAM, create or update stacks, and start Step Functions executions.
- **`AIMLSecurityMemberRole`** in the target account is not an assessment runtime role. In multi-account mode it is limited to deployment, Step Functions execution polling, and report retrieval; the SAM-created Lambda roles hold the assessment API permissions.
- **Assessment Lambda execution roles** are primarily read-oriented. They use AI/ML service `List*`, `Describe*`, and `Get*` APIs plus supporting read APIs, and S3 access to read the IAM cache and write reports.

See [README - Permissions Required](../README.md#permissions-required) for the role breakdown and the template files that define each policy.

**Q: Is this assessment sufficient for compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, and similar)?**

A: This assessment provides **a security evaluation against AWS best practices** and can support compliance efforts. However:

- Useful for demonstrating security controls and continuous monitoring
- Helps identify misconfigurations that could lead to compliance violations
- Not a substitute for formal compliance audits
- Does not cover all compliance framework requirements

Consult with your compliance team to determine how this assessment fits into your overall compliance program.

**Q: Does this framework comply with AWS Well-Architected Framework principles?**

A: Yes. The assessment checks align with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) Security Pillar, specifically:

- SEC02: Identity and Access Management
- SEC03: Detection
- SEC04: Infrastructure Protection
- SEC08: Data Protection
