# Security Checks Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for all 194 security checks performed by the AI/ML Security Assessment framework (86 core checks across Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, 32 Agentic AI Security checks, 64 Responsible AI GRC checks, and 12 OWASP Top 10 for LLM checks).

Sources differ by bucket and are not interchangeable: the core Bedrock, SageMaker, and AgentCore checks derive from the AWS Well-Architected **Generative AI Lens** security best practices (`gensec*`); the Agentic AI Security checks from the AWS Well-Architected **Agentic AI Lens**; the `FS-*` **Responsible AI GRC** checks from the AWS GRC User Guide; and the `OW-*` checks from the OWASP Top 10 for LLM. The AWS Well-Architected **Responsible AI Lens** is not a source for any of them — see [Responsible AI GRC — scope, sources, and compatibility](RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC_SCOPE.md).

The 64 Responsible AI GRC checks occupy 69 `FS-*` numbers: 64 ship as standalone checks and 5 are merged into upstream Bedrock/SageMaker checks. The framework also emits `BR-00`, `SM-00`, `AC-00`, `FS-00`, and `OW-00` operational marker rows at runtime; these are not controls and are excluded from the 194-check total. Per-control provenance, including which controls are project extensions rather than guide-derived, is recorded in [`provenance.json`](../aiml-security-assessment/functions/security/responsible_ai_grc_assessments/provenance.json).

## Check ID Convention

Each security check has a unique identifier with a service prefix:

| Prefix | Service | Example |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| **SM-XX** | Amazon SageMaker | SM-01, SM-30 (`SM-29` reserved) |
| **BR-XX** | Amazon Bedrock | BR-01, BR-40 |
| **AC-XX** | Amazon Bedrock AgentCore | AC-01, AC-17 |
| **AG-XX** | Agentic AI Security | AG-01, AG-32 |
| **FS-XX** | Responsible AI GRC | FS-01, FS-69 |
| **OW-XX** | OWASP Top 10 for LLM | OW-01, OW-12 |

### Runtime marker IDs (not controls)

The `*-00` rows below make assessment coverage and execution problems visible in
CSV and HTML reports. They are operational markers rather than security
controls, do not increase the published check counts, and must not be treated as
evidence that a control passed or failed.

| Marker | Runtime meaning | Normal status / severity |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| `BR-00` | Amazon Bedrock is unavailable or not enabled in the target region, so regional Bedrock checks were not run. | `N/A` / Informational |
| `SM-00` | Amazon SageMaker AI is unavailable or not enabled in the target region, so regional SageMaker checks were not run. | `N/A` / Informational |
| `AC-00` | Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is unavailable in the target region, or the AgentCore handler caught an unexpected per-check execution error. The error form is a diagnostic row, not a security-control failure. | Availability: `N/A` / Informational. Execution error: `Failed` / High. |
| `FS-00` | No regional Bedrock, AgentCore, or SageMaker resource footprint was found, so Responsible AI GRC was not applicable to that region. | `N/A` / Informational |
| `OW-00` | A required upstream assessment CSV was missing, so one or more mapping-derived OWASP rows could not be generated. | `N/A` / Informational |

`FS-00` is described in more detail in
[Responsible AI GRC Checks](SECURITY_CHECKS_RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC.md#fs-00--regional-scope-not-applicable-not-a-control),
and `OW-00` in
[OWASP Top 10 for LLM Security Checks](SECURITY_CHECKS_OWASP.md).

### SM-17: Processing Job Encryption

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Verifies processing job encryption.

### SM-18: Transform Job Encryption

### SM-24: A/B Testing and Shadow Deployment

- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Checks for safe deployment patterns.

### SM-25: ML Lineage Tracking

- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Validates experiment tracking and lineage.

### SM-26: GuardDuty AI Protection

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Reuses the regional GuardDuty detector inventory and verifies the `AI_PROTECTION` feature is `ENABLED`. No detector is N/A because SM-04 separately reports GuardDuty enablement.

### SM-27: HyperPod EBS CMK Encryption

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Verifies every HyperPod instance group configures a customer-managed KMS key for its root EBS volume and all configured secondary EBS volumes. AWS documents that HyperPod root volumes use an AWS-owned key by default and that a customer-managed key is supplied through `InstanceStorageConfigs`; therefore, an absent root-volume storage configuration fails this CMK baseline rather than producing `N/A`.

### SM-28: HyperPod VPC Configuration

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Verifies each HyperPod instance group's effective VPC configuration has subnets and security groups, honoring `OverrideVpcConfig` before the cluster-level `VpcConfig`.

`SM-29` is reserved for SageMaker Unified Studio private networking. It is not currently emitted because the available domain APIs do not expose a sufficient domain-level networking configuration.

### SM-30: Model Package Group Resource Policy Exposure

- **Severity:** High for public or configured-boundary violations; Informational for unclassified external sharing
- **Description:** Parses model package group resource policies to identify public wildcard principals and external accounts or organizations outside optional `AIML_APPROVED_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_IDS` / `AIML_APPROVED_ORG_IDS` boundaries. Configure those boundaries through the `ApprovedExternalAccountIds` and `ApprovedOrganizationIds` deployment parameters, respectively; both default to empty. Wildcard principals constrained by exact `aws:PrincipalAccount` or `aws:PrincipalOrgID` values, fixed-account `aws:PrincipalArn` patterns, or fixed-organization `aws:PrincipalOrgPaths` patterns are treated as bounded. Wildcard account/organization identifiers remain public; `ForAllValues` organization-path conditions count as boundaries only when a matching `Null: false` condition requires the key to be present. Because AWS supports `NotPrincipal` only with `Deny`, an `Allow` statement containing `NotPrincipal` is reported as unsupported and `N/A` rather than silently passing or being treated as public. Valid `Deny` statements do not create exposure and are ignored. If `sts:GetCallerIdentity` is unavailable, public wildcard statements are still reported, but account principals that cannot be distinguished as same-account or external produce `N/A` instead of an external-access finding. This is a conservative heuristic, not a complete IAM authorization simulator.

## Amazon Bedrock Security Checks (40)

### BR-01: AWS IAM Least Privilege

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Identifies roles with AmazonBedrockFullAccess policy.

### BR-02: Amazon VPC Endpoint Configuration

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Validates Bedrock Amazon VPC endpoints exist for private connectivity.

### BR-03: Marketplace Subscription Access

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Checks for overly permissive marketplace subscription access.

### BR-04: Model Invocation Logging

- **Description:** Checks invocation logging is enabled.

### BR-05: Guardrail Configuration

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Verifies guardrails are configured and enforced.

### BR-06: AWS CloudTrail Logging

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Validates AWS CloudTrail logging for Bedrock API calls.

### BR-07: Prompt Management

- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Validates Bedrock Prompt template usage and variants.

### BR-08: Agent AWS IAM Configuration

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Checks agent execution role permissions.

### BR-09: Knowledge Base Encryption

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Checks knowledge base encryption settings.

### BR-10: Guardrail AWS IAM Enforcement

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Verifies guardrails are enforced through AWS IAM conditions.

### BR-11: Custom Model Encryption

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Validates custom models use customer-managed AWS KMS keys.

### BR-12: Invocation Log Encryption

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Verifies logs are encrypted with AWS KMS.

### BR-13: Flows Guardrails

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Validates Bedrock Flows have guardrails attached.

### BR-14: Stale Bedrock Access

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Detects principals with Bedrock permissions that have not used the service recently, using IAM service-last-accessed data. As an IAM-global check, it runs once per execution and is tagged with the `Global` region in multi-region scans.

### BR-15: Cross-Account Guardrails Enforcement

- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Global (runs once)
- **Description:** Verifies organization-level guardrails are configured using AWS Organizations Amazon Bedrock policies (the `BEDROCK_POLICY` policy type) for centralized safety control enforcement across all accounts. Checks if running in the AWS Organizations management account, validates the Bedrock policy type is enabled at the organization root, and verifies that Bedrock policies are attached.

### BR-16: Guardrail Tier Validation

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies guardrails use the `STANDARD` content-filter tier (vs the `CLASSIC` tier) for enhanced protection and broader language support. Lists all guardrails in the region and inspects each guardrail's `contentPolicy.tier.tierName`. The STANDARD tier requires cross-Region inference.

### BR-17: Custom Model Customer-Managed KMS Encryption

- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies fine-tuned/customized models use customer-managed KMS keys instead of AWS-owned keys for greater control over encryption. Lists all custom models, retrieves model details to check KMS key configuration, and validates KMS key ARN format. This extends the existing BR-11 check by specifically verifying the type of encryption key used.

### BR-18: Model Evaluation Implementation

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Checks if model evaluation jobs exist to assess safety metrics (toxicity, accuracy, semantic robustness) before production deployment. Lists all model evaluation jobs, identifies recent evaluations (completed within 30 days), and analyzes evaluation configurations for safety metrics.

### BR-19: Prompt Flow Validation

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies Bedrock Agents prompt flows are validated using `validate_flow_definition` API before deployment to prevent misconfigured flows. Lists all flows in the region, checks for validation records or status, identifies unvalidated flows, and reports flows deployed without validation.

### BR-20: Knowledge Base Encryption Enhancement

- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Extends existing BR-09 to verify Knowledge Base encryption uses customer-managed KMS keys. Uses the authoritative knowledge base `type` (`VECTOR | KENDRA | SQL | MANAGED`) to decide how to assess each KB: for `MANAGED` knowledge bases it reads `knowledgeBaseConfiguration.managedKnowledgeBaseConfiguration.serverSideEncryptionConfiguration.kmsKeyArn` and fails KBs encrypted with an AWS-owned key; for custom vector stores (OpenSearch, RDS, Pinecone, etc.) the encryption key lives on the underlying storage resource and cannot be read from the KB API, so those are reported as N/A for manual review. If a `MANAGED` KB's encryption block is missing from the API response (deployed botocore older than 1.43.32, which silently drops the unmodeled field), the KB is reported as N/A "indeterminate" rather than a false-positive failure.

### BR-21: Agent Action Group IAM Least Privilege

- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Extends existing BR-08 to specifically check if Bedrock Agent action groups use scoped Lambda execution roles with minimal permissions. Enumerates agents and their action groups, retrieves Lambda execution roles for each action group, analyzes IAM policies for overly broad permissions (AdministratorAccess, FullAccess, Resource: "*"), and verifies principle of least privilege.

### BR-22: Model Invocation Throttling Limits

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies service quotas are configured for model invocation throttling to prevent abuse/DoS and control costs. Queries Service Quotas for Bedrock, checks if custom limits are set for on-demand model invocation TPM (tokens per minute), provisioned throughput limits, and concurrent requests. Reports accounts relying solely on default quotas.

### BR-23: Guardrail Content Filter Coverage

- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Extends existing BR-05 to verify guardrails have ALL content filters enabled (hate, insults, sexual, violence) with appropriate thresholds. For each guardrail, checks content filter configuration for all four filter types, verifies filter thresholds are configured, and reports missing or misconfigured filters.

### BR-24: Automated Reasoning Policy Implementation

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Checks if Automated Reasoning policies are configured on guardrails for formal verification of model responses. Enumerates guardrails, checks for Automated Reasoning policy configuration, validates policy syntax and enabled state, and reports guardrails without formal verification capability.

### BR-25: RAG Evaluation Jobs

- **Severity:** Low
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies RAG applications have evaluation jobs configured to assess context relevance, response correctness, and prevent hallucinations. Lists Knowledge Bases, checks for associated RAG evaluation jobs for each KB, verifies evaluation metrics include context relevance, response correctness, faithfulness, and harmfulness checks. Reports KBs without evaluation jobs.

### BR-26: Guardrail Sensitive Information Filter

- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Extends BR-23 (which covers the harmful-content filters) to verify guardrails configure sensitive-information protection. For each guardrail, reads `GetGuardrail.sensitiveInformationPolicy` and reports guardrails that have no PII entity types (`piiEntities`) or custom regex patterns (`regexes`) configured, leaving prompts and responses unscreened for sensitive data.

### BR-27: Guardrail Contextual Grounding Check

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies guardrails enable contextual grounding checks to detect hallucinated (ungrounded) and off-topic model responses. Reads `GetGuardrail.contextualGroundingPolicy.filters` and reports guardrails with no enabled grounding/relevance filters. Complements BR-25 (RAG evaluation) with a runtime control.

### BR-28: Agent Guardrail Association

- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies each Bedrock Agent has a guardrail associated so agent interactions are subject to content filtering, PII protection, and denied-topic controls. Reads `guardrailConfiguration` from the agent summaries returned by `ListAgents` and reports agents with no guardrail attached.

### BR-29: Agent Idle Session TTL

- **Severity:** Low
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies Bedrock Agents do not use an excessively long idle session TTL, which widens the window for session and conversation-context reuse. Reads `GetAgent.idleSessionTTLInSeconds` and reports agents whose TTL exceeds a conservative ceiling (3600 seconds).

### BR-30: Imported Model Customer-Managed KMS Encryption

- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Complements BR-11/BR-17 by verifying imported custom models use customer-managed KMS keys. Lists imported models and reads `GetImportedModel.modelKmsKeyArn`, reporting models encrypted with AWS-owned keys instead of a customer-managed key.

### BR-31: Batch Inference Output Encryption

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies batch inference (model invocation) jobs encrypt their S3 output with a customer-managed KMS key. Reads `outputDataConfig.s3OutputDataConfig.s3EncryptionKeyId` from the job summaries returned by `ListModelInvocationJobs` and reports jobs without a customer-managed output key.

### BR-32: CloudWatch Alarms on Bedrock Metrics

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** Verifies CloudWatch alarms exist on Amazon Bedrock runtime metrics (the `AWS/Bedrock` namespace) to detect abuse, denial-of-wallet, sustained throttling, and content-filter spikes. Uses `DescribeAlarms` and matches alarms that target the `AWS/Bedrock` namespace directly or via a metric-math expression. Only assessed in regions that have Bedrock resources.

### BR-33: Amazon Inspector Lambda Code Scanning

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Regional
- **Description:** When Lambda functions with Bedrock indicators are detected in the region, verifies Amazon Inspector Lambda standard scanning (`lambda`) and Lambda code scanning (`lambdaCode`) are both enabled so those in-scope functions and their dependencies are scanned for vulnerable packages and hardcoded secrets. Calls `lambda:ListFunctions` for scoping and `inspector2:BatchGetAccountStatus` for Inspector status. Reports `Failed` only when in-scope Lambda functions exist and either `resourceState.lambda.status` or `resourceState.lambdaCode.status` is not `ENABLED`. No in-scope Lambda functions, access denied, and region-unavailable states resolve to `N/A`.

### BR-34: Guardrail Prompt Attack Filter

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Requires each guardrail to have a preventive `PROMPT_ATTACK` input filter with `inputEnabled=true`, `inputAction=BLOCK`, and a non-`NONE` input strength. Standard tier is reported as a strengthening note.

### BR-35: Guardrail Image Content Filter Coverage

- **Severity:** Informational
- **Description:** Uses `HATE`, `INSULTS`, `SEXUAL`, and `VIOLENCE` as the cross-region image-filter baseline. Because AWS documents `MISCONDUCT` image filtering as region-dependent, its absence is not reported as a gap, but a configured `MISCONDUCT` filter is reported when its input or output modalities omit `IMAGE`. Complete coverage is `Passed`; advisory gaps are `N/A`/Informational because the scanner cannot infer whether protected applications accept or produce images.

### BR-36: Application Inference Profile Governance

- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Lists application inference profiles and reports completely untagged profiles. Organization-specific required tag keys can be enforced outside the default baseline.

### BR-37: Bedrock Account Data Retention

- **Severity:** High for provider sharing or an explicitly required zero-data-retention violation
- **Description:** Fails `provider_data_share`, passes `none`, and reports `default`/`inherit` as informational unless the `RequireBedrockZeroDataRetention` deployment parameter is `true` (`REQUIRE_BEDROCK_ZERO_DATA_RETENTION` in the Lambda), in which case those modes fail.

### BR-38: Automated Reasoning Policy CMK Encryption

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Deduplicates Automated Reasoning policy summaries and verifies each policy exposes a non-empty `kmsKeyArn`.

### BR-39: Marketplace Model Endpoint VPC Configuration

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Requires SageMaker-backed Bedrock Marketplace endpoint configurations to include non-empty VPC subnet and security-group lists.

### BR-40: Marketplace Model Endpoint CMK Encryption

- **Severity:** Medium by default
- **Description:** Resolves the Marketplace endpoint `kmsEncryptionKey` with `kms:DescribeKey` and requires `KeyMetadata.KeyManager` to be `CUSTOMER`; AWS-managed keys do not pass. The `RequireMarketplaceEndpointCMK` deployment parameter defaults to `true` (`REQUIRE_MARKETPLACE_ENDPOINT_CMK` in the Lambda). Set it to `false` to make a missing or AWS-managed key an `N/A`/Informational hardening advisory rather than a failure. An inconclusive KMS lookup is always `N/A`/Informational.

### AC-15: Code Interpreter Network Isolation

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Requires custom Code Interpreters to use `VPC` network mode with non-empty subnets and security groups.

### AC-16: Custom Browser Network Isolation

- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Requires custom browsers to use `VPC` network mode with non-empty subnets and security groups. Shares browser inventory with AC-06.

### AC-17: Online Evaluation Coverage

- **Severity:** Informational by default; Medium when required
- **Description:** Reports whether online evaluation configurations are active/enabled and include non-zero sampling, evaluators, CloudWatch input data, and output logging. Set the `RequireAgentCoreOnlineEvaluation` deployment parameter to `true` (`REQUIRE_AGENTCORE_ONLINE_EVALUATION` in the Lambda) to make incomplete coverage fail.

## Agentic AI Security Checks (32)

Agentic AI Security checks use the `AG-XX` namespace and are included with the
default assessment. They follow a hybrid model:

- Reused API-backed controls from Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
  are mapped into agentic security domains.
- New checks are added only where AWS APIs can prove the control state.
- Controls that cannot be proven by AWS APIs are not scored. Human-in-the-loop
  governance is therefore documented as a methodology note, not emitted as an
  automated pass/fail finding.

These checks reference the
[AWS Well-Architected Agentic AI Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/agentic-ai-lens/agentic-ai-lens.html),
with scope limited to the Security pillar.

### AG-24: Gateway Inbound Authorization

- **Severity:** High
- **Source:** AgentCore `ListGateways` and `GetGateway`
- **Domain:** Tool Authorization
- **Description:** Fails gateways with missing, unknown, or `NONE` authorizers. Passes `AWS_IAM` and `CUSTOM_JWT`. `AUTHENTICATE_ONLY` passes only when an AgentCore policy engine is attached in `ENFORCE` mode, because the gateway authenticates the SigV4 caller but does not make an authorization decision for that authorizer type.

- **Domain:** Bounded Autonomy
- **Description:** Maps custom Code Interpreter VPC isolation.

### AG-30: Prompt Attack Protection

- **Severity:** Source check severity
- **Source:** BR-34
- **Domain:** Prompt & Input Protection
- **Description:** Maps preventive Bedrock Guardrails prompt-attack filtering.

### AG-31: Browser Tool Isolation

- **Severity:** Source check severity
- **Source:** AC-16
- **Domain:** Bounded Autonomy
- **Description:** Maps custom AgentCore browser VPC isolation.

### AG-32: Online Evaluation Assurance

- **Severity:** Source check severity
- **Source:** AC-17
- **Domain:** Auditability & Continuous Assurance
- **Description:** Maps AgentCore online evaluation configuration without claiming universal runtime trace coverage.

### Runtime guardrail methodology note

`InvokeGuardrailChecks` / `ApplyGuardrail` are per-request runtime APIs rather than a persistent configuration surface. The assessment therefore does not emit a pass/fail finding for their use; applications should validate these calls through runtime architecture review, telemetry, and testing.

## Responsible AI GRC Checks (64 additional, 5 upstream extensions)

These 64 standalone checks (FS-XX) extend the framework with cross-industry AI
governance, risk, and compliance controls derived from the
[AWS User Guide to Governance, Risk, and Compliance for Responsible AI Adoption](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-the-updated-aws-user-guide-to-governance-risk-and-compliance-for-responsible-ai-adoption/).
An additional 5 FS checks are contributed as extensions to existing SM-07,
SM-22, SM-23, BR-04, and BR-06 (see in-file extension notes).

The full catalog is in **[`SECURITY_CHECKS_RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC.md`](./SECURITY_CHECKS_RESPONSIBLE_AI_GRC.md)**,
organized into three parts:

- **Part 1 — Infrastructure & Resource Controls** — FS-01 to FS-26
  (Unbounded Consumption, Excessive Agency, Supply Chain, Training Poisoning, Vector
  Weaknesses).
- **Part 2 — Guardrails & Content Safety** — FS-27 to FS-46
  (Non-Compliant Output, Misinformation, Abusive/Harmful Output, Biased Output,
  Sensitive Information Disclosure).
- **Part 3 — Application-Layer Controls & Material Gaps** — FS-47 to FS-69
  (Hallucination, Prompt Injection, Improper Output Handling, Off-Topic Output,
  Out-of-Date Training Data, and 6 cross-category material gap checks).

The same document includes the shared intro, severity rubric, validation note,
upstream-overlap table, and the compliance framework mapping table
(SR 11-7, FFIEC CAT, NYDFS 500.06, PCI-DSS 12.3.2, DORA Art.6, MAS TRM 9,
ISO 27001 A.12, ECOA, OWASP LLM Top 10).

## OWASP Top 10 for LLM Checks (12)

These 12 checks (OW-XX) map the AI/ML Security Assessment findings to the
[OWASP Top 10 for LLM 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/) categories.
OW-01..OW-10 are **derived by mapping** from existing BR/SM/AC/FS findings.
The OWASP Lambda itself does not call AWS APIs for mapped rows, but enabling
OWASP can auto-run Responsible AI GRC to produce FS-* source findings when
Responsible AI GRC is otherwise disabled. OW-11 and OW-12 are net-new checks
that address LLM07 (System Prompt Leakage), which the existing checks do not
directly cover.
If a required source CSV is missing, the OWASP Lambda emits an informational
`OW-00` completeness row rather than silently dropping derived rows.

**Opt-in.** OWASP checks run only when the `EnableOWASPAssessment` deployment
parameter is `true` and the Step Functions execution includes `"enableOWASP": "true"`.

**Rendered under a new "By Compliance Standard" sidebar section** of the HTML
report, alongside future NIST AI RMF and EU AI Act sections.

The full catalog is in **[`SECURITY_CHECKS_OWASP.md`](./SECURITY_CHECKS_OWASP.md)**,
organized by OWASP category:

- **LLM01 Prompt Injection** — OW-01
- **LLM02 Sensitive Information Disclosure** — OW-02
- **LLM03 Supply Chain** — OW-03
- **LLM04 Data and Model Poisoning** — OW-04
- **LLM05 Improper Output Handling** — OW-05
- **LLM06 Excessive Agency** — OW-06
- **LLM07 System Prompt Leakage** — OW-07 (mapping-based) + OW-11, OW-12 (native)
- **LLM08 Vector and Embedding Weaknesses** — OW-08
- **LLM09 Misinformation** — OW-09
- **LLM10 Unbounded Consumption** — OW-10

**Preliminary and illustrative.** OWASP mappings have not been reviewed by
external auditors. Validate mappings with your Security/Compliance team
before using as audit evidence.
