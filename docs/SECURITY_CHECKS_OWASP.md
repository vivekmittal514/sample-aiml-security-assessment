# OWASP Top 10 for LLM Security Checks

This document catalogs the 12 OWASP Top 10 for LLM (OW-XX) checks produced by
the AI/ML Security Assessment framework, and how each maps back to the
underlying BR/SM/AC/FS checks it is derived from.

- **Reference:** [OWASP Top 10 for LLM 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)
  and the category-specific remediation pages linked from that page.
- **Opt-in:** Set `EnableOWASPAssessment=true` on the deployment stack.
- **Report location:** New "By Compliance Standard" sidebar section, alongside
  the existing "By Lens" (Agentic AI) and "By Governance Framework"
  (Responsible AI GRC) sections.
- **Responsible AI GRC auto-runs when OWASP is enabled.** ~2/3 of the OWASP
  mapping rows (and all of LLM05) derive from the `FS-*` checks. To guarantee
  full OWASP coverage, the state machine automatically runs the Responsible
  AI GRC Lambda whenever `EnableOWASPAssessment=true`, even when
  `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment=false`. In that case, Responsible AI GRC
  findings are used only to derive OW-XX rows, are **hidden from the report
  UI** (no Responsible AI GRC nav item, service card, or section), and the
  raw `responsible_ai_grc_security_report_*.csv` is not copied to the
  customer-facing report bucket. Enable
  `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment=true` explicitly if you want the
  Responsible AI GRC section to appear alongside OWASP.

## Disclaimer

> **These mappings are PRELIMINARY and ILLUSTRATIVE.** They have not been
> reviewed by AWS Security Assurance Services or external auditors. Each
> organisation should validate them against its own interpretation of the
> OWASP Top 10 for LLM 2025 controls before relying on them as audit evidence.

## Design

OW-01 through OW-10 are **derived** by mapping existing findings, so the
OWASP Lambda itself does not call AWS APIs for those mapped rows. When OWASP
is enabled and Responsible AI GRC is not, the state machine still runs
Responsible AI GRC once to produce the FS-* source findings that feed OWASP
mappings; that can increase scan time and use the Responsible AI GRC IAM
surface. In CodeBuild-based deployments, the Responsible AI GRC source CSV
is filtered out when results are copied to the customer-facing report bucket
unless `EnableResponsibleAIGRCAssessment=true`. OW-11 and OW-12 are the only
**native** OWASP checks: they inspect Bedrock guardrails and Lambda env vars
for signals specific to LLM07 (System Prompt Leakage) that the existing
checks do not cover.

The OWASP Lambda runs after the per-service Lambdas have written their CSVs.
Bedrock, SageMaker, and AgentCore write per-region CSVs. Responsible AI GRC
writes one execution-scoped CSV whose unscoped evidence is labeled `Global`
rather than copied into target regions. OWASP reads those CSVs, applies the
`OWASP_CHECK_MAPPINGS` dict, runs OW-11 and OW-12, and writes
`owasp_security_report_<execution>_<region>.csv`.

If a required source CSV is missing, the Lambda emits an informational `OW-00`
coverage row instead of silently omitting all derived rows from that source.
`OW-00` is not an OWASP Top 10 control; it is a report-completeness marker.

## Extensibility

The "By Compliance Standard" sidebar section is data-driven — future NIST AI
RMF (`NR-` prefix) and EU AI Act (`EU-` prefix) additions require only
appending a new entry to `COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS` in `report_template.py` and
following the same Lambda/CFN wire-up pattern (`EnableNISTAssessment` /
`EnableEUAIActAssessment`). Each new prefix must be 2–3 uppercase letters to
satisfy the Check_ID regex `^[A-Z]{2,3}-\d{2}$`.

## Check catalogue

Each emitted OW row uses the category-specific OWASP remediation reference

### LLM07 System Prompt Leakage — OW-07 (mapping) + OW-11, OW-12 (native)

Mapping-based (OW-07) signals:

| Source | Signal |
| -------- | -------- |
| BR-04 | Bedrock model invocation logging enabled (§4.3 prompt logging) |
| BR-07 | Bedrock Prompt Management adoption (§2.2 prompts as code) |
| BR-16 | Guardrail Standard tier (Standard tier additionally detects prompt-leakage) |

Native checks fill the gap:

- **OW-11: System Prompt Embedded in Lambda Env Var**
  Heuristic: flag Lambda functions whose env vars are ≥ 200 chars and
  match **at least two distinct** prompt-shaped multi-word phrases from
  `SYSTEM_PROMPT_HEURISTIC_PHRASES` (e.g. `"you are a"`, `"you are an"`,
  `"your role"`, `"your task"`, `"you must"`, `"you should"`,
  `"helpful assistant"`, `"as an assistant"`, `"system prompt"`,
  `"system instruction"`, `"never reveal"`, `"do not reveal"`,
  `"internal instruction"`, `"respond politely"`). Multi-word phrases
  and the ≥ 2-match requirement are deliberate — the check is designed
  **not** to flag ordinary configuration blobs (policy JSON, log format
  strings, runbook text) that contain isolated words like `"system"` or
  `"instruction"`. Recommend moving prompts to Bedrock Prompt Management.
  Severity: Medium (control-inherent — same on Passed and Failed).

- **OW-12: System-Prompt-Disclosure Denied Topic**
  Verify at least one Bedrock guardrail's `topicPolicy` contains a DENY
  topic whose name or definition mentions "system prompt", "instruction
  disclosure", "prompt leakage", "reveal instructions", or "internal prompt".
  Severity: Medium (control-inherent — same on Passed and Failed).

**Severity convention.** OW-11 and OW-12 are native checks; their
severity is control-inherent (same on Passed and Failed), matching the
Responsible AI GRC severity methodology. OW-01..OW-10 mapping rows inherit the
source check's severity except when the source is `N/A`, in which case
the OWASP row is downgraded to `Informational` to avoid inflating
severity totals with tooling / no-resource rows.

## Severity / status semantics

OW rows follow the same rules as every other check in the framework:

- The row's `Severity` and `Status` are inherited from the source finding.
  An N/A source produces an OW row with `Severity=Informational` and
  `Status=N/A` — never an inflated High/Medium.
- Access-denied / region-unsupported paths in OW-11/OW-12 → `N/A`, never
  `Failed`.
- Missing source CSVs for mapping-derived rows produce `OW-00` with
  `Severity=Informational` and `Status=N/A`.
- The `Reference` field on every OW row points to the category-specific
  remediation page linked from <https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/>, not the
  AWS docs. This keeps report rows aligned to the OWASP category they satisfy
  even when the underlying misconfiguration was surfaced by a BR/SM/AC/FS
  source check.
